# Staged-recipes

[`staged-recipes`](/docs/maintainer/infrastructure#staged-recipes) is the gateway to conda-forge.
Every package published has gone through this repository as part of the submission process.

## Submission to staged-recipes

Users normally follow these steps:

1. Fork the `conda-forge/staged-recipes` repository and create a new branch from `main`.
2. Add a `meta.yaml` or `recipe.yaml` file (plus other files as needed) in a new subdirectory under `recipes/`.
3. Open a new pull request and pass the CI checks, which include building the recipe under different operating systems and some static analysis of the recipe files (linting).
4. Ask for a review and apply the suggestions.

When the PR is approved and merged to `main`, the new directory under `recipes/` will trigger the `staged-recipes` pipelines, which will create a new feedstock with the recipe contents.

## Feedstock creation

Once a new recipe has been merged into `staged-recipes`, it will be converted to a feedstock.
This creates the home of the recipe as a new repository under the `conda-forge` organization.
It also creates the associated team and registers the recipe with the CI providers that are used for building packages, as well as with the distribution infrastructure to allow for uploads.

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant sr as staged-recipes repo
    participant ar as admin-requests repo
    loop Several times per hour
        ar->>sr: check for new recipes
        loop for every new recipe
            create participant cs as conda-smithy
            ar->>cs: register github
            create participant fs as feedstock repo
            participant cf as conda-forge organization
            participant ci as ci providers
            cs->>fs: create feedstock repo
            cs->>cf: create maintainers team
            cs->>fs: add maintainers team
            ar->>cs: register ci
            cs->>ci: register builds
            destroy cs
            cs->>ar: finish
            ar->>sr: remove recipe from staged-recipes
        end
    end
```

Once the feedstock creation is completed successfully, all future events are handled through the feedstock;
the `staged-recipes` repository no longer plays a role.
