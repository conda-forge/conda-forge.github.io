# Configuring conda-forge.yml

import CondaForgeYmlSchema from '@site/src/components/CondaForgeYmlSchema';

You can configure how conda-forge is set up and built via the `conda-forge.yml`
file that is present in the root directory of a feedstock.

Rerendering the feedstock after you modify this file is usually required and always a good idea (see [Rerendering feedstocks](updating_pkgs.md#dev-update-rerender)).

The next section describes in detail the top-level fields in `conda-forge.yml`.
