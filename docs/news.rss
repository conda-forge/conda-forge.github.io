            <description><![CDATA[We will bump the minimum MacOS version from 10.13 (released in Sept. 2017, end-of-life since]]></description>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>We will bump the minimum MacOS version from 10.13 (released in Sept. 2017, end-of-life since
Dec. 2020) to 11.0 (released Nov. 2020, end-of-life since Sept. 2023) sometime next week.</p>
<p>This will not affect already-published artefacts, and you will not receive incompatible builds
even when still using an older Mac. However, going forward, to be able to keep using the most
recent packages from conda-forge, you will need to update your OS to at least 11.0.</p>
<p>The reason conda-forge is able to support macOS versions far beyond their end-of-life is due to the
fact that -- unlike many other paradigms -- we are able to always ship an up-to-date C++ standard
library (<code>libcxx</code> on OSX) in user environments, superseding the system library (at least from the
point of view of packages in the respective conda environments) that's usually too outdated for
contemporary packaging needs.</p>
<p>However, several core packages in the ecosystem have begun requiring 11.0 or newer, in a way
that we cannot be circumvent. The key driver for this is <code>libcxx</code> itself; it has a foundational
role in our infrastructure, and many aspects depend on this library being up-to-date. Given that
<code>libcxx</code> itself will begin requiring macOS 11.0 as of v22.1, we need to follow suit.</p>
<p>Other fundamental packages that already require a newer deployment target is the <code>qt</code> ecosystem,
languages like <code>go</code>, <code>nodejs</code>, <code>dotnet</code>, <code>zig</code>, and key libraries like <code>libabseil</code> and <code>libprotobuf</code>.
Since <code>go</code> already requires a deployment target of at least 12.0, we have added a custom
<a href="https://github.com/conda-forge/conda-forge-pinning-feedstock/blob/main/recipe/migrations/go_macos.yaml" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="">migrator</a>
that will send PRs to update <code>go</code>-feedstocks without having to do manual modifications.</p>
<p>As soon as we make the switch, all new builds (on properly rerendered feedstocks) in conda-forge
for OSX will require at least 11.0. This constraint is implemented via the <code>{{ stdlib("c") }}</code>
meta-package, which picks up <code>c_stdlib_version</code> from our global pinning (unless
<a href="https://conda-forge.org/docs/maintainer/knowledge_base/#requiring-newer-macos-sdks" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="">overridden</a>
on the feedstock in <code>recipe/conda_build_config.yaml</code>), and will inject (on OSX) a corresponding constraint
on <code>__osx &gt;=11</code> in the package metadata. This instructs the resolver to ignore such artefacts on
older systems, ensuring that no incompatible packages get installed.</p>
<p>If you are overriding <code>c_stdlib_version</code> or <code>MACOSX_SDK_VERSION</code> to values &lt;=11.0 in your feedstock,
please remove that configuration, as it has become redundant.</p>
<p>For more details (or questions) about this, see <a href="https://github.com/conda-forge/conda-forge.github.io/issues/2467" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="">https://github.com/conda-forge/conda-forge.github.io/issues/2467</a>.</p>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Tegra devices are system on chip (SOC) devices used in robotics and other mobile
applications. They are a Linux ARM (aarch64) platform variant which must be targeted
separately from Server Base System Architecture (SBSA) ARM when compiling for CUDA 12.x and
earlier. Non-NVIDIA feedstock maintainers may now build Tegra variants for their CUDA 12.9
packages if they choose by following <a href="https://github.com/conda-forge/cuda-feedstock/blob/main/recipe/doc/recipe_guide.md#building-for-arm-tegra-devices" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="">these
directions</a>.</p>
<p>This special Tegra variant is only relevant for packages still targeting CUDA 12.9
because starting with CUDA 13.0, supported Tegra devices are SBSA-compliant, so they
do not need to be targeted separately.</p>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Starting with conda-smithy 3.54.0, the generated build scripts for macOS
will no longer use the system SDK directory for downloading the SDK versions
we require, but will use a dedicated <code>/opt/conda-sdks</code> directory instead.
Users performing local builds will need to choose a writable directory,
and provide the path to it via the environment variable <code>OSX_SDK_DIR</code>.</p>
<p>This change may result in some build systems, particularly CMake,
storing paths to this temporary build directory in installed metadata.
Feedstocks will need to substitute the stored paths with path-agnostic
solutions (for example, see <a href="https://github.com/conda-forge/openpmd-api-feedstock/blob/15f9b3648f087d3e06331d6ec9ddff0710300593/recipe/build.sh#L100-L107" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="">substitutions in

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>CUDA 11.8 is the last holdover from the old days before conda-forge
<a href="https://github.com/conda-forge/conda-forge.github.io/issues/1963" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="">switched</a>
to the new and shiny CUDA 12+ infrastructure, where the CUDA toolchain
is provided as native conda-packages, rather than a blob in an image.</p>
<p>For CUDA-enabled feedstocks, we've been building both 11.8 and 12.6 by default
for a while now, but many feedstocks (notably pytorch, tensorflow, onnx, jax etc.)
have dropped CUDA 11.8 for many months already.</p>
<p>Due to various constraints (details below), we are dropping CUDA 11.8 as a default
version in our global pinning on June 5th. It will still be possible to opt into
building CUDA 11.8 on a per-feedstock basis where this is necessary or beneficial.</p>
<p>The above-mentioned contraints are mainly:</p>
<ul>
<li class="">it <a href="https://github.com/conda-forge/conda-forge-pinning-feedstock/issues/6967" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="">complicates our pinning</a> due to needing to switch images and compilers with 11.8.</li>
<li class="">it keeps us from <a href="https://github.com/conda-forge/conda-forge-pinning-feedstock/pull/7005" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="">migrating</a>
to newer CUDA 12.x versions necessary to support new architectures.</li>
<li class="">it's <a href="https://github.com/conda-forge/conda-forge.github.io/issues/2138#issuecomment-2916743741" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="">not compatible with VS2022</a>, which is due to become the default toolchain on windows
in conda-forge soon (the previous VS2019 has reached end-of-life more than a year ago).</li>
<li class="">it complicates our infrastructure in several places, due to the big differences between the
before/after of the new CUDA architecture.</li>
</ul>
<p>After we have removed CUDA 11.8 from the pinning, any feedstock still building that version
will drop the respective CI jobs upon rerendering. For feedstocks wanting to keep building
CUDA 11.8 a bit longer, we have provided a custom migrator.</p>
<p>The way to make use of this is to copy
<a href="https://github.com/conda-forge/conda-forge-pinning-feedstock/blob/main/recipe/migrations/cuda118.yaml" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class=""><code>cuda118.yaml</code></a>
from the global pinning into <code>.ci_support/migrations</code> on your feedstock.
If the <code>migrations</code> subfolder doesn't exist, please create it. Once that's committed
(and there are no skips in the recipe for CUDA 11.8), rerendering the feedstock
will reinstate the builds for CUDA 11.8. If you have trouble with that, please open
a thread on <a href="https://conda-forge.zulipchat.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="">https://conda-forge.zulipchat.com/</a>.</p>
<p>Finally, please let us
know in the <a href="https://github.com/conda-forge/conda-forge-pinning-feedstock/issues/7404" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="">issue</a>
if your feedstock still needs to support CUDA 11.8 and why (later down the line we'll want to
drop support also in conda-forge-ci-setup, and knowing what feedstocks - if any - still need
CUDA 11.8 will help guide the decision on timing).</p>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Yesterday, <code>conda-forge</code> was notified of a security incident reporting that the <code>anaconda.org</code> upload token
for the <code>conda-forge</code> channel had been accidentally leaked between on or about 2025-02-10 to 2025-04-01. Our
investigation resulted in the temporary artifact upload shutdown you observed yesterday (2025-04-01). The results

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>TL;DR: We have made some updates to our Docker images and build time GLIBC selection.</p>
<ol>
<li class="">We've updated our default docker images to be based on alma9</li>
<li class="">It is now easier to override <code>c_stdlib_version</code> (especially for CUDA-enabled feedstocks), though our baseline of 2.17 hasn't changed.</li>
<li class="">Where necessary, you can more easily switch images by setting <code>os_version: ...</code> (see below).</li>
<li class="">We've consolidated our image names to follow a consistent pattern:</li>
</ol>
<div class="language-text codeBlockContainer_Ckt0 theme-code-block" style="--prism-color:#393A34;--prism-background-color:#f6f8fa"><div class="codeBlockContent_QJqH"><pre tabindex="0" class="prism-code language-text codeBlock_bY9V thin-scrollbar" style="color:#393A34;background-color:#f6f8fa"><code class="codeBlockLines_e6Vv"><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain">linux-anvil-{x86_64,aarch64,ppc64le}:{cos7,alma8,alma9}</span><br></span></code></pre></div></div>
<p>In general, it won't be necessary in the vast majority of cases to override the
docker-image, but if you need to do so, you can add the following to <code>conda-forge.yml</code></p>
<div class="language-text codeBlockContainer_Ckt0 theme-code-block" style="--prism-color:#393A34;--prism-background-color:#f6f8fa"><div class="codeBlockContent_QJqH"><pre tabindex="0" class="prism-code language-text codeBlock_bY9V thin-scrollbar" style="color:#393A34;background-color:#f6f8fa"><code class="codeBlockLines_e6Vv"><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain">os_version:             # just to demo different values;</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain">  linux_64: cos7        # whenever possible, please use</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain">  linux_aarch64: alma8  # homogeneous distro versions</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain">  linux_ppc64le: alma9  # across platforms</span><br></span></code></pre></div></div>
<p>Linux builds in conda-forge run on infrastructure derived from RHEL and its clones
-- previously CentOS, now AlmaLinux. Primarily we need this for four different
interrelated but distinct pieces:</p>
<ul>
<li class="">the docker images (containing the OS which will execute our builds)</li>
<li class="">the sysroot (mainly the C standard library, <code>glibc</code>)</li>
<li class="">the CDTs (pieces from the distribution we cannot package ourselves)</li>
<li class="">feedstock usage of <code>yum_requirements.txt</code></li>
</ul>
<p>A first key observation is that the glibc appears twice -- once explicitly in the
sysroot we package (and compile against!), and once implicitly in the image that
our CI runs on. This setup is essential to provide highly compatible packages by
default (by compiling against a cos7 baseline), while avoiding constant hassles
for feedstocks where <em>any</em> of the build/host/run dependencies requires a newer
glibc than the baseline.</p>
<p>This is because, for packages requiring a newer <code>c_stdlib_version</code> (and thus compiling
against a newer sysroot through the <code>{{ stdlib("c") }}</code> infrastructure), will inherit
a runtime-requirement of <code>__glibc &gt;=c_stdlib_version</code>, which would be unsatisfiable on
docker-images with a too-old glibc present at runtime.</p>
<p>We've already had this setup since 2021 (when our glibc baseline was 2.12 from cos6,
yet we already used cos7 images), but after increasing the glibc baseline to 2.17, our
images had lost their lead again. This is mostly related due to the third component from
above, the CDTs (core dependency trees). These represent packages from the distribution
itself that are hard or impossible for us to provide, yet need a systematic way to
interact with. You can read more about <em>why we want to avoid them as much as possible</em>
<a href="https://conda-forge.org/docs/maintainer/knowledge_base/#why-are-cdts-bad" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="">here</a>.</p>
<p>Due to the end of CentOS-as-we-knew it, we already had to rewrite a lot of the logic
there in any case to switch to Alma, which we took as an opportunity to pare down the
set of CDTs we provide going forward. In a large majority of cases, we have regular
conda packages for some things that only used to be available as CDTs.</p>
<p>CDTs and packages in <code>yum_requirements.txt</code> are closely related; in many ways it can
be considered a similar compilation-vs.-runtime split as is the case with our sysroot
(that we compile against) vs. the glibc in the image at runtime. The split here being
that CDTs are what we use to compile against a given distro package, and <code>yum_requirements.txt</code>
are how we tell the infrastructure to install them into the image, if they're also
necessary at runtime (which is not always the case).</p>
<p>In other words, using our own packages generally allows feedstocks to avoid <em>both</em> use
of CDTs and <code>yum_requirements.txt</code>. You can check out the CDTs we removed
<a href="https://github.com/conda-forge/cdt-builds/issues/66#issuecomment-1833417828" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="">here</a>
and how <code>yum_requirements.txt</code> translate from CentOS to Alma (resp. our own packages)
<a href="https://github.com/conda-forge/conda-forge-pinning-feedstock/issues/6283#issuecomment-2440281086" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="">here</a>.</p>
<p>The change of the image might mean that CDTs we have not repackaged for Alma do not
match what's actually in the image anymore, or -- in rare cases -- that a package name
under <code>yum_requirements.txt</code> needs to be updated. Please let us know if you run into
problems there (after checking out the two links above how to transition a given package).</p>
<p>Finally, there is one rare case where we explicitly ask feedstock authors to opt out
of the newest images: for any feedstocks doing binary repackaging on linux (i.e. not
compiling the package from source), please ensure that your image version (as specified
in <code>conda-forge.yml</code>, see above) matches the <code>c_stdlib_version</code> that you are using.
By default this is 2.17, which means you'd have to do</p>

<p>If you require a <code>c_stdlib_version</code> of 2.28 for a given platform, then set <code>alma8</code>.</p>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>We have changed our feedstock output validation procedure. Instead of automatically
adding new packages to existing feedstocks (e.g., when a new output is added), we will now
require that maintainers submit a PR to add the new output via our
<a href="https://github.com/conda-forge/admin-requests?tab=readme-ov-file#add-a-package-output-to-a-feedstock" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="">admin-requests repository</a>.
New feedstocks created via <code>staged-recipes</code> will have their outputs added automatically. If you maintain a feedstock
that regularly adds new outputs (e.g., <code>llvmdev</code> has <code>libllvm18</code>, <code>libllvm19</code>, etc.), you can use the <code>admin-requsts</code> repo
to add a glob pattern that matches the pattern of your new outputs. We test these patterns aginst new outputs from the feedstock
using the Python <code>fnmatch</code> module. Outputs from the feedstock that match a glob pattern will added automatically. Further
details on package output validation can be found in our <a href="https://conda-forge.org/docs/maintainer/infrastructure/#output-validation-and-feedstock-tokens" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="">documentation</a>.</p>]]></content:encoded>
