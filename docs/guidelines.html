<h2>Transferring to conda-forge<a class="headerlink" href="#transferring-to-conda-forge" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>This document intends to layout some guidelines on the transfer of
<a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/conda/conda-recipes">conda-recipes</a> and
<a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/ContinuumIO/anaconda-recipes">anaconda-recipes</a>
to conda-forge. These aren’t hard and fast rules. They are certainly up
for discussion. However, it would be good to come up with a consensus
going forward.</p>
<p>Eventually all recipes from those repos should be proposed for
addition here. It may be decided that a few don’t actually belong or
should not be supported anymore.</p>
<p>When adding a package from either location, inspect the commit history
to see who has made changes to the recipe in the past. Anyone who has
touched the recipe should be pinged about it getting added here. They
should also be consulted with regards to whether the recipe needs any
tweaks before being added. Also, they should be asked if they would
like to be added as maintainers. Only if they give express permission
to be adding as a maintainer should they be added to the maintainer list.
In all cases when porting a recipe, you should add yourself as a
maintainer. Some contributors to these repos were quite prolific, but may
not be as actively engaged. If they specify they only want to be contacted
for certain recipes or none at all, please respect their wishes also add
make note of what recipes (if any) they would like to be notified for. If
they are no longer interested in any conda recipes, make that note here
as well. Before contacting anyone please consult the list in this
<a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/conda-forge/staged-recipes/issues/139">issue</a>
to see if that contributor has restrictions.</p>
<p>When porting make sure the recipe follows the linting specifications.
The section order should go <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">package</span></code>, <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">source</span></code>, <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">build</span></code>,
<code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">requirements</span></code>, <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">test</span></code>, <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">about</span></code>, <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">extra/recipe-maintainers</span></code>. It
is recommended to add a <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">build</span></code> section with the <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">number</span></code> set to
<code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">0</span></code> explicitly even if the rest is unneeded. If there is no build for
Windows, make sure to add <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">skip:</span> <span class="pre">True</span>&#160; <span class="pre">#</span> <span class="pre">[win]</span></code> to the <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">build</span></code>
section. The <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">about</span></code> section must have the <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">home</span></code> URL (verify the
URL is still correct), <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">license</span></code> (verify the correct license is present),
and a one sentence (or few word) <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">summary</span></code>. When specifying the version it
is strongly recommend that jinja templating be used to set the version
at the top (e.g. <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">{%</span> <span class="pre">set</span> <span class="pre">version</span> <span class="pre">=</span> <span class="pre">&quot;0.10.1&quot;</span> <span class="pre">%}</span></code>) and then replace all
uses of the version with <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">{{</span> <span class="pre">version</span> <span class="pre">}}</span></code>. Preference should be given to
compressed source balls as opposed to version control checkouts. Make sure
all links to compressed source balls allow for easy changing of the version
(using latest is not acceptable). Also, a checksum should be included with
all compressed source balls to allow for verification of downloads.</p>
<p>It is required to add tests with all packages. These can include but are
not limited to checking libraries are installed, python imports, simple
code snippet to compile or run a basic test, command line usage (checking
help or version). It is suggested that compiled code run all tests (e.g.
<code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">make</span> <span class="pre">check</span></code>) to ensure it was built properly. This normally should
happen in the build.</p>

<h2>Intended Usage<a class="headerlink" href="#intended-usage" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Maintainers’ time and CI resources are what enable conda-forge. They are as scarce as they are valuable. conda-forge has enough capacity to support releasing packages, but not developing them.</p>
<p>Publishing a package to conda-forge signals it is suitable for users not involved with development. However, publishing does not always happen error-free. Multiple commits are acceptable when debugging issues with the release process itself.</p>
<dl class="docutils">
<dt>Fortunately, there are options for optimizing the development of a package.</dt>

<li><a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/conda-forge/conda-smithy">conda-smithy</a> is a tool used by conda-forge itself to manage feedstocks. conda-smithy can be used to create an internal development feedstock that is seperate from conda-forge.</li>

<h2>Renaming Packages<a class="headerlink" href="#renaming-packages" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Sometimes packages are misnamed. To correct the name of the package, please submit a PR into staged-recipes with the correct name. During the review process please make certain to note that the package is a rename and contact a member of conda-forge/core to remove the old feedstock (and potentially package if needed).</p>
