## What is conda-forge?

conda-forge is a community effort and a GitHub organization which contains repositories of conda recipes and thus provides conda packages for a wide range of software.
The built distributions are uploaded to [anaconda.org/conda-forge](https://anaconda.org/conda-forge) and can be installed with [conda](https://conda.pydata.org/docs/intro.html).

**Missing a package that you would love to install with conda?**

Chances are we have already packaged it for you. You can [search](https://anaconda.org/) for packages online. Look out for packages provided by our `conda-forge` organization.

**Cannot find a package or only outdated versions of a package?** - Everybody is welcome to contribute to our package stack!
