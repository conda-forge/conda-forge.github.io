# How to get help at conda-forge

You could connect with us via **Element, GitHub Issues or Discourse Group**.
We would be happy to hear from you!

## Element chatroom

If you are just starting out with conda-forge and/or feel completely lost, we recommend getting in touch through [Element chatroom](https://app.element.io/#/room/#conda-forge:matrix.org). Our community members will direct
you to the proper documentation and/or help you via the chat.

<a id="github-issues"></a>

## GitHub issues

You can open issues at [staged-recipes](https://github.com/conda-forge/staged-recipes/issues)
to request a new package or to report a problem with staged-recipes itself (our port of entry to conda-forge).

Or you can open an issue about a specific package at the package feedstock via
`https://github.com/conda-forge/<PACKAGE-NAME>-feedstock/issues`

When opening issues, be sure to:

* Try a new environment first following conda-forge [install instructions](introduction.md#how-to-install).
* Always open a new one when an issue is closed. In the packaging world symptoms may be similar but the causes are usually very different.
* Fill in the required information. Without the output of conda list and conda info -a the team cannot debug the problem.

You can open issues at [conda-forge.github.io](https://github.com/conda-forge/conda-forge.github.io/issues)
for long threads involving infrastructural, architectural or ecosystem wide discussions.
Please note that some of these discussions will be turned into policy via the [CFEP process](https://github.com/conda-forge/conda-forge-enhancement-proposals).

## Discourse Group

You can subscribe to our [Discourse group](https://conda.discourse.group) and post your queries there. The Discourse group is a secondary home for long threads about the ecosystem.
