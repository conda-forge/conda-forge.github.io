    * What are we supposed to do with conda packages for feedstocks that are no longer being actively maintained
        * Epoch out packages archived feedstocks?
            * Package based messaging?
        * one user perspective: would prefer correct and/or up-to-date versus "works for the thing i did one year ago"
* (CJ) Testing story, encourage people to add full test suites?
    * Mixed responce, table for later
* (John) Update on GPU packaging
    * Made docker images, based on NVIDIA CUDA images

### Subteam updates

#### Bot

* (CJ) Python 3.8 migration is [ready](https://github.com/conda-forge/conda-forge-pinning-feedstock/pull/279)
* (CJ) migration graphs are plotted (see [arch plot](https://github.com/regro/cf-graph-countyfair/blob/master/status/archrebuild.svg))
* (CJ) Heroku [running out of memory](https://github.com/conda-forge/status/issues/60)
    * Fix the rerender use lower RAM
    * Pay for larger RAM

#### ARM

#### Docs

#### staged-recipes

#### website

### CI infrastructure
* (CJ) Problems with Appveyor downgrade to free?
* (Marius, Isuru) Azure migration update?
* Do we want to roll out https://github.com/conda-forge/conda-smithy/issues/1131 to all feedstocks?

#### Compiler upgrade
* (Isuru) Update to clang 8.0.1 and gfortran 7.3.0 on OSX
    * No rebuild necessary. (Rebuild for gfortran 7.3.0 is already done. We build with 7.3.0 and 4.8.5)
    * This should be pain free except for some packages that do -Wall -Werror.
    * We get better compilers.
    * We don't have to rely on defaults as we build these in conda-forge CI.
    * We get a linker that supports .tbds .
      (new linker might work with older compiler, but not sure about packages compiled with -flto)

*

### Your agenda items

## Discussion

* Funding round?

### jeremy howard's criticisms and discussion
* It's still difficult to get involved
* Ralf, as a numpy / scipy maintainer, still struggles to understand how to get involved.
    * External project maintainers plus maintainers of recipe -- so-and-so already owns it how can i start contributing to the package.
* the average user doesn't want to think about glibc. it's an implementation detail that the average packager doesn't want to think about. Most people are happy to follow these guidelines
