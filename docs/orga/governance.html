<h1>Governance<a class="headerlink" href="#governance" title="Permalink to this heading">¶</a></h1>
<p>This document outlines the policies and procedures that manage the conda-forge
community. This document recognizes that, while packaging is deeply important
to all of us, conda-forge is an all-volunteer organization. Members of the
core, any team, or external contributors choose to participate and may
choose to leave at any time for any reason or for no reason. We deeply
appreciate all good faith contributions.</p>
<section id="code-of-conduct">
<span id="id1"></span><h2>Code of Conduct<a class="headerlink" href="#code-of-conduct" title="Permalink to this heading">¶</a></h2>
<p>Conda-forge adheres to the
<a class="reference external" href="https://www.numfocus.org/code-of-conduct">NumFOCUS Code of Conduct</a>.</p>
</section>
<section id="teams-roles">
<h2>Teams &amp; Roles<a class="headerlink" href="#teams-roles" title="Permalink to this heading">¶</a></h2>
<p>Here are defined the primary teams participating in conda-forge activities.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p><strong>core:</strong> The core team is the governing body over the entire conda-forge
organization. Members of the core team have full rights over all conda-forge
repositories. Members of core are the face of the project, and are responsible
for officially interfacing with external communities, organizations, non-profits,
and companies. The core team may create new sub-teams, as appropriate.
Each member of core is entitled to one vote on all elected matters.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>staged-recipes:</strong> The staged-recipes team administers the staged-recipes
repository and is responsible for the review and creation of new feedstocks.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>maintainers:</strong> A maintainer is an individual responsible for the management
of one or more feedstock repositories and packages. Maintainers have the ability
to merge pull requests into the feedstock of only the packages they maintain.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>external contributors:</strong> This group encompasses all others who are not on
core, part of staged-recipes, or maintainers. This includes first-time
contributors, collaborators, and funders. They have no special rights within
the conda-forge organization itself.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>emeritus-core:</strong> Core members that are inactive (commits, GitHub comments/issues/reviews,
dev meetings and voting on polls) in the past six months will be asked if they want to become emeritus-core
developers. Any core member can also request to become emeritus if they wish to do so
(e.g. taking a sabbatical or long vacation).
Emeritus core members can still vote and move back to active core anytime. Emeritus
votes are used to count towards quorum but the quorum size is computed from the size of
the active core group. The <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">core.csv</span></code> list should be updated when a change in the status
of a member occurs.</p></li>
</ul>
</section>
<section id="sub-teams">
<h2>Sub-Teams<a class="headerlink" href="#sub-teams" title="Permalink to this heading">¶</a></h2>
<p>The core team may elect to create new sub-teams for managing the daily business
of the organization. While sub-teams may have non-core members, every sub-team
must have at least one core team member at all times. If a sub-team fails to
have  a core team member for more than 1 week, that team is considered to be
dissolved. A new sub-team would need to be established by the core in order to
reinstate the activity.</p>
<p>Sub-teams have a charter that is either <em>dynamic</em> or <em>static</em>.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>A <em>dynamic</em> charter means that the sub-team is self-organizing, with respect
to its own internal policies, procedures, and membership. A sub-team may choose
to modify its membership independent of the core team. For example, a
Google Summer of Code team could be a good candidate for a dynamic charter.
Alternatively, language-based maintenance teams also have a dynamic charter.</p></li>
<li><p>A <em>static</em> charter means that all membership decisions and non-trivial policy
changes must be approved by the core team. For example, a finance team
may require a static charter.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>All sub-teams must adhere to the governance, policies, and procedures of
conda-forge at all times.</p>
</section>
<section id="voting">
<h2>Voting<a class="headerlink" href="#voting" title="Permalink to this heading">¶</a></h2>
<p>This section presents descriptions and criteria for voting items in the
conda-forge community. The core team is the only team with voting rights.
Members of core may also call a vote on any topic. The restrictions on
calling a vote are as follows:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>There must only be one vote active on a particular item at any time.</p></li>
<li><p>The act of calling for a vote cannot itself violate the code of
conduct. For example, Sam repeatedly called for votes immediately
after a previous vote failed to achieve Sam’s result. Sam is
attempting to bully other members of core into agreeing, and is thus
violating the code of conduct.</p></li>
<li><p>Voting yes moves the proposal forward;
voting no is the only way to express opposition to the proposal;
not voting is discouraged, but non-votes do not count as “no”.</p></li>
<li><p>There should always be an option to abstain from voting.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Voting items are labeled as either <strong>standard</strong> or <strong>sensitive</strong>.
Standard items are ones where public record and discourse is
preferable. Sensitive voting items are ones where the results of the
vote should remain private to the voters after the vote has occurred.
Sensitive votes should take place on a secure anonymous voting platform
in order to retain election integrity and anonymity. (We have used <a class="reference external" href="https://polys.me">Polys</a>
and <a class="reference external" href="https://vote.heliosvoting.org/">the Helios voting system</a>, but are
open to any secure, anonymous system.) The email capability of your chosen
voting platform should be used for sending voting invitations and reminders,
and you should use the email list from
<a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/conda-forge/conda-forge.github.io/blob/main/src/core.csv">https://github.com/conda-forge/conda-forge.github.io/blob/main/src/core.csv</a>
and <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/conda-forge/conda-forge.github.io/blob/main/src/emeritus.csv">https://github.com/conda-forge/conda-forge.github.io/blob/main/src/emeritus.csv</a>
as the authoritative list of emails to use.</p>
<p>The default voting period is 1 week (7 days). This may be modified at
the time when a vote is called, but may never be less than 24 hrs.</p>
<p>Additional requirements may apply in case low turnouts have to be handled, see “Quorum” below.</p>
<p>To call for a standard vote, here is a template PR comment:</p>
<div class="highlight-md notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="ni">@conda</span>-forge/core
This PR falls under the {policy} policy, please vote and/or comment on this PR.
This PR needs {policy_percent} of core to vote yea to pass.
To vote please leave Approve (yea) or Request Changes (nay) reviews.

<dl class="field-list">
<dt class="field-odd">Quorum<span class="colon">:</span></dt>
<dd class="field-odd"><p>Quorum for votes can be met in one of three ways depending on the
vote: the standard quorum rules, the accelerated quorum rules, and the
“time out” quorum rules. The specific quorum rules applicable
for each vote are listed below.</p>
<p><strong>Standard Quorum Rules</strong>: All percentages below express <em>both</em>
required participation, as a
fraction of the active core team, as well as the fraction of that
fraction who vote affirmatively on the issue. For example, in a vote
requiring 50%, with 18 active core members, at least 9 must vote;
if 9 vote, there must 5 affirmative votes. If 13 members vote, 7
must be affirmative.</p>
<p><strong>Accelerated Quorum Rules</strong>: For certain votes, we allow a lower quorum level.
For these votes,
if the voting period is longer than a week and there are no “no” votes, a quorum
of half of the size
needed for a <strong>standard quorum</strong> above is acceptable. For example, for a vote
requiring 50% with 18
active core members, at least 5 people must vote “yes” and exactly 0 people
must vote “no”.</p>
<p><strong>Time-out Quorum Rules</strong>: Votes not achieving quorum will eventually time out on their set end date.
When this happens,
the current participation level is taken for what it is, and the percentage
of affirmative votes is calculated from whatever the vote total is at that
time.  In order for a timeout to occur, the vote must have:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><ul class="simple">
<li><p>been open for at least 2 weeks</p></li>
<li><p>been presented and discussed at a Core team meeting</p></li>
<li><p>been advertised on at least 3 separate occasions on the element core
chatroom (beginning of voting period, middle, and one day prior to
proposed timeout)</p></li>
<li><p>been sent to core members via email.  Email reminders must have been
sent to the core email list in a manner similar to the element chatroom: at least 3 times,
occurring as beginning of voting period, middle, and one day
prior to proposed timeout.</p></li>
</ul>
</div></blockquote>
<p>Extending the above example, if 9 people are required for a quorum, but
only 7 have voted, those 7 votes can form the basis of a completed vote
after the above conditions are met. 4 votes within those 7 would be
needed to pass the vote.</p>
<p>To post a timeout reminder, here is a template comment:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><div class="highlight-md notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="ni">@conda</span>-forge/core
This vote falls under the {policy} policy, please vote
and/or comment on this PR.
This vote needs {policy_percent} of core to vote yea to pass.
This vote presently has {current_voters}, and needs
{policy_percent * core - current_voters} more for quorum.
It is proposed that this vote will time out and be
evaluated with the current votes in {days}, on {date}.
To vote please leave Approve (yea) or Request Changes (nay)
reviews.
</pre></div>
</div>
</div></blockquote>
<p>To declare a standard vote “timed out,” the person making such a declaration
must post a pull-request adding
a vote record to the <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/conda-forge/conda-forge.github.io/tree/main/vote-results">vote-results folder</a>.
The declaration PR should be merged by the first core member
who is available to verify that
the requirements for the timeout have been met, based on their
own personal records.</p>
