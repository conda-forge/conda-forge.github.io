# Index of CFEPs

Changes to the project should be submitted as **conda-forge enhancement proposals (CFEP)**.
These CFEPs are similar to [Python's PEP](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/) and
[IPython's IPEP](https://github.com/ipython/ipython/wiki/IPEPs:-IPython-Enhancement-Proposals) processes.

CFEPs are stored in the [cfep GitHub repository](https://github.com/conda-forge/cfep).
A list of conda-forge enhancement proposals (CFEP) are as follows:
