<section id="transferring-to-conda-forge">
<h2>Transferring to conda-forge<a class="headerlink" href="#transferring-to-conda-forge" title="Permalink to this heading">¶</a></h2>
<p>This document intends to layout some guidelines on the transfer of
<a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/conda/conda-recipes">conda-recipes</a> and
<a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/ContinuumIO/anaconda-recipes">anaconda-recipes</a>
to conda-forge. These aren’t hard and fast rules, instead are open to reasonable
interpretation and reviewer’s judgement.</p>
<p>It is anticipated that almost all recipes from those repos shall be
proposed for addition here, though it may be decided that a few don’t
actually belong or should not be supported anymore.</p>
<p>While adding a package from either location, inspect the commit history
to see who had made changes to the recipe in the past. Anyone who has
touched the recipe should be pinged about it, so that they can be added here. They
should also be consulted with regards, if the recipe needs any
tweaks before being added. Also, they should be asked if they would
like to be added as maintainers. If they give their consent
to take up the role as a maintainer, only then they should be added in the maintainer list.</p>
<p>In all cases while porting a recipe, you should add yourself as a
maintainer. Some contributors to these repos might be quite prolific, but may
not be as actively engaged. If they specify they only want to be contacted
for certain recipes or none at all, please respect their wishes and add them too.
Make note of what recipes (if any) they would like to be notified for. If
they are no longer interested in any conda recipes, make that note here
as well. Before contacting anyone, please consult the list in this
<a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/conda-forge/staged-recipes/issues/139">issue</a>
to see if that contributor has restrictions.</p>
<p>While porting make sure the recipe follows the linting specifications.
The section order should go <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">package</span></code>, <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">source</span></code>, <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">build</span></code>,
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">requirements</span></code>, <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">test</span></code>, <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">about</span></code>, <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">extra/recipe-maintainers</span></code>. It
is recommended to add a <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">build</span></code> section with the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">number</span></code> set to
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">0</span></code> explicitly even if the rest is unneeded. If there is no build for
Windows, make sure to add <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">skip:</span> <span class="pre">True</span>&#160; <span class="pre">#</span> <span class="pre">[win]</span></code> to the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">build</span></code>
section. The <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">about</span></code> section must have the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">home</span></code> URL (verify if the
URL is still correct), <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">license</span></code> (verify if the correct license is present),
and a one sentence (or few words) <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">summary</span></code>. When specifying the version, it
is strongly recommended that jinja templating be used to set the version
at the top (e.g. <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">{%</span> <span class="pre">set</span> <span class="pre">version</span> <span class="pre">=</span> <span class="pre">&quot;0.10.1&quot;</span> <span class="pre">%}</span></code>) and then replace all
uses of the version with <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">{{</span> <span class="pre">version</span> <span class="pre">}}</span></code>. Preference should be given to
compressed source balls as opposed to version control checkouts. Make sure
all links to compressed source balls allow for easy changing of the version
(using latest is not acceptable). Also, a checksum should be included with
all compressed source balls to allow for verification of downloads.</p>
<p>It is required to add tests with all packages. These can include, but are
not limited to, checking if libraries are installed, python imports, simple
code snippet to compile or run a basic test, command line usage (checking
help or version). It is suggested to get the compiled code to run all tests (e.g.
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">make</span> <span class="pre">check</span></code>) to ensure it was built properly. This normally should
happen in the build.</p>
<p>It is possible, though not recommended, to include multiple recipes into a
single pull request on <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/conda-forge/staged-recipes">staged-recipes</a>. <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">conda-build-all</span></code> is used to determine
the build order and the necessary build matrix (e.g. which python versions to
build against). From a practical perspective, there are limitations on the
continuous integration resources and also on what reviewers are able/willing
to review in a single pull request.
A large pull request with numerous recipes makes it more difficult to review.
If the recipes make it through these two constraints and are merged, race
conditions amongst the different feedstocks may require work by you and/or
core maintainers to restart them in such a way to build everything in a
suitable order.
None of this is to say that one can’t add multiple recipes in a single
pull request. One certainly can do this and it can work, but the
recommendation is to open a PR with one recipe first, and to ping
<strong>&#64;conda-forge/core</strong> to ask for agreement about adding one or two additional
recipes.</p>

<section id="intended-usage">
<h2>Intended Usage<a class="headerlink" href="#intended-usage" title="Permalink to this heading">¶</a></h2>
<p>Maintainers’ time and CI resources are what enable conda-forge. They are just as scarce as valuable. conda-forge has enough capacity to support releasing packages, but not developing them.</p>
<p>Publishing a package to conda-forge signals it is suitable for users not involved with development. However, publishing does not always happen error-free. Multiple commits are acceptable when debugging issues with the release process itself.</p>
<dl class="simple">
<dt>Fortunately, there are options for optimizing the development of a package.</dt><dd><ul class="simple">
<li><p><a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/conda-forge/conda-smithy">conda-smithy</a> is a tool used by conda-forge itself to manage feedstocks. conda-smithy can be used to create an internal development feedstock that is separate from conda-forge.</p></li>

<section id="renaming-packages">
<h2>Renaming Packages<a class="headerlink" href="#renaming-packages" title="Permalink to this heading">¶</a></h2>
<p>Sometimes, packages are misnamed.
To correct the name of the package, please submit a PR into <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/conda-forge/staged-recipes">staged-recipes</a> with the correct name.
During the review process, please make certain to note that the package is renamed and contact a member of conda-forge/core to remove the old feedstock (and potentially package, if needed).</p>
<p>Occasionally, the .gitmodules file in the <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/conda-forge/feedstocks/blob/master/.gitmodules">feedstocks</a> needs to be updated to remove the old feedstock.
It’s not entirely clear what those circumstances are.
See <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/conda-forge/conda-forge.github.io/issues/1070">conda-forge.github.io#1070</a>.</p>
<p>If an existing feedstock has already created a package of the same name,
then you may need to add the new feedstock to the <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/conda-forge/feedstock-outputs">feedstock-outputs</a> map.</p>
</section>
<section id="fixing-broken-packages">
<span id="fix-broken-packages"></span><h2>Fixing Broken Packages<a class="headerlink" href="#fixing-broken-packages" title="Permalink to this heading">¶</a></h2>
<p>Sometimes, you need to remove a package from the conda-forge channel on Anaconda.org.
There can be many reasons for this, but the ones that immediately come to mind are:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Incorrect pinnings or metadata</p></li>
<li><p>Packages being renamed</p></li>
<li><p>Broken package contents</p></li>
</ul>
<p>We prefer to not remove packages for the following reasons:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li><p>Unaffected users are unable to get the broken package.</p></li>
<li><p>Unable to reverse (what if we were incorrect to remove it).</p></li>
<li><p>Loss of reproducibility (unable to create an old environment).</p></li>
<li><p>Not as community friendly (leaves no opportunity to review decision).</p></li>
<li><p>Blocks anyone from inspecting the broken packages.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Instead, if possible, we prefer to take one of the following actions:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li><p>If the only issue is in the package metadata, we can directly patch it using
the <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/conda-forge/conda-forge-repodata-patches-feedstock">repo data patches feedstock</a>.
To change the repo data for your package, make a PR on the feedstock.</p></li>
<li><p>If the the package contents themselves are broken, we add an extra label <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">broken</span></code>
to the package. Packages with this extra label are removed from the repo data on the
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">main</span></code> label. Thus they are not considered by the solver
but their binaries are still available on Anaconda.org. To get the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">broken</span></code> label
added to your package, please refer to <a class="reference internal" href="../maintainer/updating_pkgs.html#maint-fix-broken-packages"><span class="std std-ref">Removing broken packages</span></a>.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Adding the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">broken</span></code> label to a package is more destructive than patching the repo data
and thus we prefer repo data patches over labeling things as <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">broken</span></code>.</p>

<section id="becoming-a-maintainer">
<h2>Becoming a maintainer<a class="headerlink" href="#becoming-a-maintainer" title="Permalink to this heading">¶</a></h2>
<p>Conda-forge is a community project and it can therefore happen that feedstocks become temporarily abandoned.
You can join the maintainer team of a feedstock by adding your github-id to the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">recipe-maintainers</span></code> section in the recipe’s <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">meta.yaml</span></code>.
Please refer to <a class="reference internal" href="../maintainer/updating_pkgs.html#maint-updating-maintainers"><span class="std std-ref">Updating the maintainer list</span></a> for detailed instructions.</p>
</section>
<section id="language-versions">
<h2>Language versions<a class="headerlink" href="#language-versions" title="Permalink to this heading">¶</a></h2>
<p>Conda-forge contains packages from a number of languages including Python and R, among many others.
Each of these language-specific packaging sub-ecosystems needs to keep cadence with the language itself, making it challenging to have a blanket policy for how long to keep older versions of the language around.
As it comes up, each group should be able to define their own policy on how long to keep older versions of their language around.</p>
<section id="python">
<h3>Python<a class="headerlink" href="#python" title="Permalink to this heading">¶</a></h3>
<p>For the Python language, conda-forge aims to keep package builds active and available for the current version and at least two preceding minor versions.
Whenever Python 4.0 comes out we’ll need to figure out if this policy should change to support multiple versions of 3.x and 4.x simultaneously.
Fortunately, we can punt on that for now.
The question of when to decide to drop an older language version remains.
The guidance that we can provide here is two fold:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li><p>We will move with the community.
When our core libraries stop supporting an old version, so too will conda forge.
The (nonexhaustive) list of core libraries that we consider when making the decision to drop an older version are:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>matplotlib</p></li>
<li><p>numpy</p></li>
<li><p>scipy</p></li>
<li><p>pypy</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>The core team can decide to keep an old version around temporarily until some specific criteria is met.
For example, we’re holding off on turning off py36 until pypy comes out with pypy3.7.</p></li>
<li><p>If there are lots of people in the community relying on older versions, core team can decide to keep an old version around.
For example, we held off turning off py27 even after numpy, scipy dropped support as there were many in the community interested in keeping support until the end of life of that version.</p></li>
</ol>

</section>
<section id="reviewing-recipes">
<span id="reviewer-guidelines"></span><h2>Reviewing recipes<a class="headerlink" href="#reviewing-recipes" title="Permalink to this heading">¶</a></h2>
<p>To add new packages to conda-forge, users can submit a PR to <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">staged-recipes</span></code> (see <a class="reference internal" href="../maintainer/adding_pkgs.html#dev-contribute-pkgs"><span class="std std-ref">Contributing packages</span></a> for more details),
where it will undergo a series of automated checks and a code review.
Any conda-forge member can perform a code review, but the final merge can only be done by the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">staged-recipes</span></code> or <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">core</span></code> teams.
The following sections suggest guidelines on how to perform a successful code review.
We distinguish between “Required” and “Recommended” as follows:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Required: These guidelines are very important and a requisite for PR acceptance. Exceptions are rare and usually require  <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">core</span></code> approval.</p></li>
<li><p>Recommended: These are considered “nice to have” features. Ideally, all recipes should abide by them, but exceptions are tolerated as long as justifiable reasons are provided.</p></li>
</ul>
<section id="generalities">
<h3>Generalities<a class="headerlink" href="#generalities" title="Permalink to this heading">¶</a></h3>
<p>Required:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li><p>All interactions in the review adhere to our <a class="reference internal" href="governance.html#code-of-conduct"><span class="std std-ref">Code of Conduct</span></a>.</p></li>
<li><p><code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">conda-forge-linter</span></code> <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/conda-forge/conda-smithy/blob/main/conda_smithy/lint_recipe.py">checks</a> pass successfully.
Sometimes the linter will also suggest modifications considered optional (hints); even if recommended, these are not required to accept the submission.</p></li>
<li><p>The CI checks pass successfully in the required platforms. Exceptions:
- <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">noarch:</span> <span class="pre">python</span></code> can fail in platforms other than Linux (e.g. missing dependency). For non-noarch packages, the failing platform should be skipped via <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">skip:</span> <span class="pre">true</span>&#160; <span class="pre">#</span> <span class="pre">[&lt;platform</span> <span class="pre">selector&gt;]</span></code>
- CI times out or runs out of storage because it tries to build all Python versions in the same job. As long as one version passes, that’s ok, since they will run individually in the resulting feedstock.</p></li>
<li><p>The submission fulfills the <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/conda-forge/staged-recipes/blob/main/.github/pull_request_template.md">pull request template checklist</a>.</p></li>
<li><p>The license has been correctly identified and allows redistribution.</p></li>
<li><p>The source should not contain vendored code. If it does:
- Package the vendored project separately and specify the needed dependency in the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">requirements</span></code> section. Preferred if the vendored code is needed at runtime.
- Allow the vendored code, but make sure the license files are included in the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">about.license</span></code> field. Usually ok if it’s only a build-time dependency (e.g. headers-only library)</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Recommended:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li><p>Source should be obtained from a URL that provides a stable tarball (same SHA over time).
Git or other SVC repositories should only be used as a last resort.</p></li>
<li><p>Host requirements contained in the <a class="reference internal" href="../maintainer/pinning_deps.html#pinned-deps"><span class="std std-ref">conda-forge pinnings</span></a> should be <em>name-only</em>; i.e. they do not specify a separate version.</p></li>
<li><p>Runtime requirements are not pinned too strictly without justification.
Thanks to repodata patches, we can afford to be optimistic about lower or upper bounds instead of single-version pins: <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">&gt;=1.4.2,&lt;1.5</span></code> is better than <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">==1.4.2</span></code>.</p></li>
<li><p>The package should place its files under standard locations (e.g. executables under <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">$PREFIX/bin</span></code>), unless justification is provided.</p></li>
</ol>
</section>
<section id="python-specific-details">
<h3>Python-specific details<a class="headerlink" href="#python-specific-details" title="Permalink to this heading">¶</a></h3>
<p>Required:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li><p><code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">noarch:</span> <span class="pre">python</span></code> packages fulfill the <a class="reference internal" href="../maintainer/knowledge_base.html#noarch"><span class="std std-ref">required criteria</span></a> to be considered as such.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Recommended:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li><p>The package does not accidentally include a <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">tests</span></code> (also <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">test</span></code>, <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">_tests</span></code>, or similar) top-level package.
The list of files is usually printed by <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">pip</span> <span class="pre">install</span></code> after the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">adding</span> <span class="pre">license</span> <span class="pre">file</span></code> message.
If this happens, upstream should modify their <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">setuptools.find_packages()</span></code> usage accordingly.
Alternatively, a patch can be applied. See <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/conda-forge/staged-recipes/pull/19166/commits/0284fc6da273031a4f93a1fea4533822cd4b385d">example</a>.</p></li>
<li><p>The modules checked by <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">test.imports</span></code> are not empty (this can happen with placeholder <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">__init__.py</span></code> files in top-level packages).</p></li>
<li><p>The versions reported by <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">pip</span> <span class="pre">list</span></code> and <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">conda</span> <span class="pre">build</span></code> logs match.</p></li>
<li><p><code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">pip</span> <span class="pre">check</span></code> passes. See <a class="reference internal" href="../maintainer/adding_pkgs.html#pip-check"><span class="std std-ref">pip check</span></a> for more details.</p></li>
<li><p>If a project can be considered <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">noarch</span></code> (see <a class="reference internal" href="../maintainer/knowledge_base.html#noarch"><span class="std std-ref">criteria</span></a>), it should be packaged as such.</p></li>
</ol>
</section>
<section id="compiled-objects">
<h3>Compiled objects<a class="headerlink" href="#compiled-objects" title="Permalink to this heading">¶</a></h3>
<p>Required:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li><p>The source does not include compiled files.
In principle, all compiled objects need to be generated in the CI, from source.
Exceptions to this rule (e.g. binary repackaging) need to be approved explicitly.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Recommended:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li><p>SONAMEs follow naming recommendations given by upstream.</p></li>
<li><p>If ABI compatibility is important for the package, <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">run_exports</span></code> are set accordingly.
