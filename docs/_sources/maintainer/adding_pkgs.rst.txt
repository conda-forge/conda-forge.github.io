.. _creating_recipes:

The staging process
===================

This document presents an overview over how to contribute packages to conda-forge.


Getting Started
---------------

There are multiple ways to get started:

#. Look at `the example recipe <https://github.com/conda-forge/staged-recipes/tree/master/recipes/example>`_ in the staged-recipes repository and modify it as necessary.
#. If it is an R package from `CRAN <https://cran.r-project.org/>`_, please
   instead start by using the `conda-forge helper script for R recipes <https://github.com/bgruening/conda_r_skeleton_helper>`_.
   Then if necessary you can make manual edits to the recipe.
#. If it is a python package, you can generate the recipe as a starting point with
   ``grayskull pypi your_package_name``. To install it you can use `conda install -c conda-forge grayskull`. You do *not* have to use grayskull, and the
   recipes produced by grayskull will need to be reviewed and edited.
   In particular, you'll at least need to check the build line to :ref:`use pip <use-pip>`,
   add yourself as a maintainer,
   and specify a ``license_file``.

Your final recipe should have no comments (unless they're actually relevant to the recipe, and not generic instruction comments), and follow the order in the example.

*If there are details you are not sure about please open a pull request. The conda-forge team will be happy to answer your questions.*

In case you are building your first recipe using conda-forge, a step-by-step instruction and checklist that might help you with a successful build is provided in the following.

.. _staging_steps:

Step-by-step Instructions
-------------------------

#. Ensure your source code can be downloaded as a single file. Source code
   should be downloadable as an archive (.tar.gz, .zip, .tar.bz2, .tar.xz)
   or tagged on GitHub, to ensure that it can be verified. (For further
   detail, see :ref:`tarballs_no_repos`).
#. Fork the `example recipes
   <https://github.com/conda-forge/staged-recipes/tree/master/recipes>`_
   repository.
#. Create a new branch from the staged-recipes ``master`` branch.
#. Within your forked copy, generate a new folder in the recipes subdirectory
   and copy the `meta.yml
   <https://github.com/conda-forge/staged-recipes/blob/master/recipes/
   example/meta.yaml>`_
   file from the example directory. Please leave the example directory
   unchanged!
#. Edit the copied recipe (meta.yml) as needed. For details, see
   :ref:`meta_yaml`.
#. Generate the SHA256 key for your source code archive, as described in the
   example recipe using the ``openssl`` tool. As an alternative, you can also
   go to the package description on `PyPi <https://pypi.org>`_ from which you
   can directly copy the SHA256.
#. Be sure to fill in the ``test`` section. The simplest test will simply
   test that the module can be imported, as described in the example.
#. Remove all irrelevant comments in the ``meta.yaml``  file.

.. tip::

  Be sure not to checksum the redirection page. Therefore use, for example,::

    curl -sL https://github.com/username/reponame/archive/vX.X.X.tar.gz | openssl sha256

Checklist
.........

* Ensure that the license and license family descriptors (optional) have the right case and that the license is correct. Note that case sensitive inputs are required (e.g. Apache-2.0 rather than APACHE 2.0). Using SPDX identifiers for license field is recommended. (see :ref:`spdx`)
* Ensure that you have included a license file if your license requires one -- most do. (see `here <https://github.com/conda-forge/staged-recipes/blob/a504af81c05491bf7b0b018b2fa1efe64767985c/recipes/example/meta.yaml#L52-L55>`_)
* In case your project has tests included, you need to decide if these tests should be executed while building the conda-forge feedstock.
* Make sure that all tests pass successfully at least on your development machine.
* Recommended: run the test locally on your source code to ensure the recipe works locally (see  :ref:`staging_test_locally`).
* Make sure that your changes do not interfere with other recipes that are in the ``recipes`` folder (e.g. the ``example`` recipe).


Feedback and revision
---------------------

Once you finished your PR, all you have to do is waiting for feedback from our reviewer team.

The reviewer team will assist you by pointing out improvements and answering questions. Once the package is ready, the reviewers will approve and merge your pull request.

After merging the :term:`PR`, our infrastructure will build the package and make it available in the conda-channel.

.. note::

  If you have questions or have not heard back for a while, you can notify us by including ``@conda-forge/staged-recipes`` in your GitHub message.


Post staging process
--------------------

* After the PR is merged, our :term:`CI` services will create a new git repo automatically. For example, the recipe for a package named ``pydstool`` will be moved to a new repository `https://github.com/conda-forge/pydstool-feedstock <https://github.com/conda-forge/pydstool-feedstock>`_. This process is automated through a CI job on the ``conda-forge/staged-recipes`` repo. It sometimes fails due to API rate limits and will automatically retry itself. If your feedstock has not been created after a day or so, please get in touch with the ``conda-forge/core`` team for help.
* CI services will be enabled automatically and a build will be triggered automatically which will build the conda package and upload to `https://anaconda.org/conda-forge <https://anaconda.org/conda-forge>`_
* If this is your first contribution, you will be added to the conda-forge `team <https://github.com/orgs/conda-forge/people>`_ and given access to the CI services so that you can stop and restart builds. You will also be given commit rights to the new git repository.
* If you want to make a change to the recipe, send a :term:`PR` to the git repository from a fork. Branches of the main repository are used for maintaining different versions only.


Maintainer role
---------------

The maintainer's job is to:

- Keep the feedstock updated by merging eventual maintenance :term:`PR`\ s from conda-forge's bots.
- Keep the feedstock on par with new releases of the source package by

  - Bumping the version number and checksum.
  - Making sure that the feedstock's requirements stay accurate.
  - Make sure the test requirements match those of the updated package.

- Answer eventual questions about the package on the feedstock issue tracker.


Adding multiple packages at once
--------------------------------

If you would like to add more than one related packages, they can be added to
staged-recipes in a single pull request (in separate directories). If the
packages are interdependent (i.e. one package being added lists one or more of
the other packages being added as a requirement), the build script will be able to
locate the dependencies that are only present within staged-recipes as long as
the builds finish in the dependencies order. Using a single pull request
allows you to quickly get packages set up without waiting for each package in a
dependency chain to be reviewed, built, and added to the conda-forge channel
before starting the process over with the next recipe in the chain.

.. note::

   When PRs with multiple interdependent recipes are merged,
   there may be an error if a build finishes before its dependency is built. If
   this occurs, you can trigger a new build by pushing an empty commit.

   .. code-block:: none

      git commit --amend --no-edit && git push --force


Synchronizing fork for future use
---------------------------------

If you would like to add additional packages in the future, you will need to
reset your fork of staged-recipes before creating a new branch on your fork,
adding the new package directory/recipe, and creating a pull request. This
step ensures you have the most recent version of the tools and configuration
files contained in the staged-recipes repository and makes the pull request
much easier to review. The following steps will reset your fork of
staged-recipes and should be executed from within a clone of your forked
staged-recipes directory.

#. Checkout your master branch::

     git checkout master

#. Define the conda-forge/staged-recipes repository as “upstream” (if you have not already done so).::

     git remote add upstream https://github.com/conda-forge/staged-recipes.git

#. Pull all of the upstream commits from the upstream master branch.::

     git pull --rebase upstream master

#. Push all of the changes to your fork on GitHub (make sure there are not any changes on GitHub that you need because they will be overwritten).::

     git push origin master --force

Once these steps are complete, you can continue with the steps in :ref:`staging_steps` to stage your new package recipe using your existing staged-recipes fork.


.. _meta_yaml:

The recipe meta.yaml
====================

The ``meta.yaml`` file in the recipe directory is at the heart of every conda package.
It defines everything that is required to build and use the package.

``meta.yaml`` is in `yaml <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YAML>`__ format, augmented with `Jinja <http://jinja.pocoo.org/>`__ templating.

A full reference of the structure and fields of ``meta.yaml`` file can be found in the `Defining metadata (meta.yaml) <https://conda.io/projects/conda-build/en/latest/resources/define-metadata.html>`__ section in the conda-build documentation.

In the following, we highlight particularly important and conda-forge specific information and guidelines, ordered by section in ``meta.yaml``.


Source
------

.. _tarballs_no_repos:

Build from tarballs, not repos
..............................

Packages should be built from tarballs using the ``url`` key, not from repositories directly by using e.g. ``git_url``.

There are several reasons behind this rule:

  - Repositories are usually larger than tarballs, draining shared CI time and bandwidth
  - Repositories are not checksummed.  Thus, using a tarball has a
    stronger guarantee that the download that is obtained to build from is
    in fact the intended package.
  - On some systems, it is possible to not have permission to remove a repo once it is created.

Populating the ``hash`` field
.............................

If your package is on PyPi_, you can get the sha256 hash from your package's page
on PyPI; look for the ``SHA256`` link next to the download link on your package's
files page, e.g. ``https://pypi.org/project/<your-project>/#files``.

You can also generate a hash from the command line on Linux (and Mac if you
install the necessary tools below).

To generate the ``sha256`` hash: ``openssl sha256 your_sdist.tar.gz``

You may need the openssl package, available on conda-forge
``conda install openssl -c conda-forge``.

.. tip::

  Be sure not to checksum the redirection page. Therefore use, for example,::

    curl -sL https://github.com/username/reponame/archive/vX.X.X.tar.gz | openssl sha256

.. _PyPi: https://pypi.org

Downloading extra sources and data files
........................................

``conda-build 3`` supports multiple sources per recipe. Examples are available `in the conda-build docs <https://conda.io/projects/conda-build/en/latest/source/define-metadata.html#source-from-multiple-sources>`_.


Build
-----

Skipping builds
...............

Use the ``skip`` key in the ``build`` section along with a selector:

You can e.g. specify not to build ...

 - on specific architectures:

  .. code-block:: yaml

      build:
          skip: true  # [win]

 - for specific python versions:

  .. code-block:: yaml

    build:
        skip: true  # [py<35]

A full description of selectors is
`in the conda docs <https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda-build/en/latest/resources/define-metadata.html#preprocessing-selectors>`__.


Optional: ``bld.bat`` and/or ``build.sh``
.........................................

In many cases, ``bld.bat`` and/or ``build.sh`` files are not required.
Pure Python packages almost never need them.

If the build can be executed with one line, you may put this line in the
``script`` entry of the ``build`` section of the ``meta.yaml`` file with:
``script: "{{ PYTHON }} -m pip install . -vv"``.

Remember to always add ``pip`` to the host requirements.


.. _use-pip:

Use pip
.......
Normally Python packages should use this line:

.. code-block:: yaml

    build:
      script: "{{ PYTHON }} -m pip install . -vv"

as the installation script in the ``meta.yml`` file or ``bld.bat/build.sh`` script files,
while adding ``pip`` to the host requirements:

.. code-block:: yaml

    requirements:
      host:
        - pip

These options should be used to ensure a clean installation of the package without its
dependencies. This helps make sure that we're only including this package,
and not accidentally bringing any dependencies along into the conda package.

Usually pure-Python packages only require ``python``, ``setuptools`` and ``pip``
as ``host`` requirements; the real package dependencies are only
``run`` requirements.


Requirements
------------

Build, host and run
...................

Conda-build distinguishes three different kinds of dependencies.
In the following paragraphs, we give a very short overview what packages go where.
For a detailed explanation please refer to the `conda-build documentation <https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda-build/en/latest/source/resources/define-metadata.html#requirements-section>`__.

**Build**

  Build dependencies are required in the build environment and contain all tools that are not needed on the host of the package.

  Following packages are examples of typical ``build`` dependencies:

   - compilers (see :ref:`dep_compilers`)
   - cmake
   - make
   - pkg-config
   - CDT packages (see :ref:`cdt_packages`)


**Host**

  Host dependencies are required during build phase, but in contrast to build packages they have to be present on the host.

  Following packages are typical examples for ``host`` dependencies:

   - shared libraries (c/c++)
   - python/r libraries that link against c libraries (see e.g. :ref:`linking_numpy`)
   - python, r-base
   - setuptools, pip (see :ref:`use-pip`)

**Run**

  Run dependencies are only required during run time of the package. Run dependencies typically include

   - most python/r libraries


.. _no_external_deps:

Avoid external dependencies
...........................

As a general rule: all dependencies have to be packaged by conda-forge as well. This is necessary to assure :term:`ABI` compatibility for all our packages.

There are only a few exceptions to this rule:

#. Some dependencies have to be satisfied with :term:`CDT` packages (see :ref:`cdt_packages`).

#. Some packages require root access (e.g. device drivers) that cannot be distributed by conda-forge. These dependencies should be avoided whenever possible.



Pinning
.......

Linking shared c/c++ libraries creates dependence on the :term:`ABI` of the library that was used at build time on the package.
The exposed interface changes when previously existing exposed symbols are deleted or modified in a newer version.

It is therefore crucial to ensure that only library versions with a compatible :term:`ABI` are used after linking.

In the best case, the shared library you depend on:

- defines a pin in the `list of globally pinned packages <https://github.com/conda-forge/conda-forge-pinning-feedstock/blob/master/recipe/conda_build_config.yaml>`__

- exports its :term:`ABI` compatible requirements by defining ``run_exports`` in it's meta.yaml

In these cases you do not have to worry about version requirements:

.. code-block:: yaml

  requirements:
    # [...]
    host:
      - readline
      - libpng

In other cases you have to specify :term:`ABI` compatible versions manually.

.. code-block:: yaml

  requirements:
    # [...]
    host:
      - libawesome 1.1.*

For more information on pinning, please refer to :ref:`pinned_deps`.


Constraining packages at runtime
................................

The ``run_constrained`` section allows defining restrictions on packages at runtime without depending on the package. It can be used to restrict allowed versions of optional dependencies and defining incompatible packages.

Defining non-dependency restrictions
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Imagine a package can be used together with version 1 of ``awesome-software`` when present, but does not strictly depend on it.
Therefore you would like to let the user choose whether he/she would like to use the package with or without ``awesome-software``. Let's assume further that the package is incompatible to version 2 of ``awesome-software``.

In this case ``run_dependencies`` can be used to restrict ``awesome-software`` to version 1.*, if the user chooses to install it:

.. code-block:: yaml

  requirements:
    # [...]
    run_constrained:
      - awesome-software 1.*

Here ``run_constrained`` acts as a means to protect users from incompatible versions without introducing an unwanted dependency.

Defining conflicts
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Sometimes packages interfere with each other and therefore only one of them can be installed at any time.
In combination with an unsatisfiable version, ``run_constrained`` can define blockers:


.. code-block:: yaml

  package:
  name: awesome-db

  requirements:
    # [...]
    run_constrained:
      - amazing-db ==9999999999

In this example, ``awesome-db`` cannot be installed together with ``amazing-db`` as there is no package ``amazing-db-9999999999``.


.. _testing_in_recipes:

Test
----



All recipes need tests. Here are some tips, tricks, and justifications.
How you should test depends on the type of package (python, c-lib,
command-line tool, ... ), and what tests are available for that package.
But every conda package must have at least *some* tests.


Simple existence tests
......................

Sometimes defining tests seems to be hard, e.g. due to:

 - tests for the underlying code base may not exist.
 - test suites may take too long to run on limited :term:`CI` infrastructure.
 - tests may take too much bandwidth.

In these cases, conda-forge may not be able to execute the prescribed test suite.

However, this is no reason for the recipe to not have tests. At the very least,
we want to verify that the package has installed the desired files in the desired
locations. This is called existence testing.

Existence testing can be accomplished in the ``meta.yaml`` file in the
``test/commands`` block.

On posix systems, use the ``test`` utility and the ``$PREFIX`` variable.

On Windows, use the ``exist`` command. See below for an example.

Simple existence testing example:


.. code-block:: yaml

    test:
      commands:
        - test -f $PREFIX/lib/libboost_log$SHLIB_EXT  # [unix]
        - if not exist %LIBRARY_LIB%\\boost_log-vc140-mt.lib exit 1  # [win]


Testing python packages
.......................

For the best information about testing, see the conda build docs
`test section. <https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda-build/en/latest/resources/define-metadata.html#test-section>`_


Testing importing
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The minimal test of a python package should make sure that the package
can be successfully imported. This can be accomplished with this
stanza in the ``meta.yaml``:

.. code-block:: yaml

    test:
      imports:
        - package_name

Note that ``package_name`` is the name imported by python;
not necessarily the name of the conda package (they are sometimes different).

Testing for an import will catch the bulk of the packaging errors, generally
including the presence of dependencies. However, it does not assure that the
package works correctly. In particular, it doesn't test if it works
correctly with the versions of dependencies used.

It is good to run some other tests of the code itself (the test suite) if possible.

Running unit tests
..................

The trick here is that there are multiple ways to run unit tests in Python,
including nose, pytest, etc.

Also, some packages install the tests with the package, and thus they can be
run in place, while others keep the tests with the source code, and thus can
not be run straight from an installed package.

Test requirements
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Sometimes there are packages required to run the tests that are not required
to simply use the package. This is usually a test-running framework, such as
nose or pytest. You can ensure that it is included by adding it to requirements
in the test stanza:

.. code-block:: yaml

    test:
      imports:
        - package_name
    ...
      requires:
        - pytest

Copying test files
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Often test files are not installed alongside packages. Conda creates a fresh
working copy to execute the test stage of build recipes, which don't contain
the files of source package.

You can include files required for testing with the ``source_files`` section:

.. code-block:: yaml

    test:
      imports:
        - package_name
      requires:
        - pytest
      source_files:
        - tests
        - test_pkg_integration.py
      commands:
        - pytest tests test_pkg_integration.py

The ``source_files`` section works for files and directories.

Built-in tests
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Some packages have testing built-in. In this case, you can put a test command
directly in the test stanza:

.. code-block:: yaml

    test:
      ...
      commands:
         python -c "import package_name; package_name.tests.runall()"

Alternatively, you can add a file called ``run_test.py`` in the recipe that
will be run at test time. This allows an arbitrarily complicated test script.

pytest tests
^^^^^^^^^^^^

If the tests are installed with the package, pytest can find and run them
for you with the following command::

    test:
      requires:
        - pytest
      commands:
        - pytest --pyargs package_name


Command Line Utilities
......................

If a python package installs command line utilities, you probably want to test that
they were properly installed::

    test:
      commands:
        - util_1 --help

If the utility actually has a test mode, great. Otherwise simply invoking
``--help`` or ``--version`` or something will at least test that it is
installed and can run.

Tests outside of the package
............................

Note that conda-build runs the tests in an isolated environment after installing
the package -- thus, at this point it does not have access to the original source
tarball.  This is to ensure that the test environment is as close as possible to
what an end-user will see.

This makes it very hard to run tests that are not installed with the package.

.. **NOTE** if anyone has good ideas as to how to do that, please put it here!


.. _staging_test_locally:

Running tests locally for staged recipes
........................................

If you want to run and build packages in the staged-recipes repository locally,
go to the root repository directory and run the
``.scripts/run_docker_build.sh`` script.  This requires that you have docker
installed on your machine.

You need to define an environment variable named ``CONFIG``. Its value must be
the name of one of the three YAML configuration files in the ``.ci_support``
directory (either ``linux64``, ``osx64``, or ``win64``). As an example, you can
invoke the command as follows.

.. code-block:: sh

    $ cd staged-recipes
    $ CONFIG=linux64 ./.scripts/run_docker_build.sh


About
-----

Packaging the license manually
..............................

Sometimes upstream maintainers do not include a license file in their tarball despite being demanded by the license.

If this is the case, you can add the license to the ``recipe`` directory (here named ``LICENSE.txt``)  and reference it inside the meta.yaml:


.. code-block:: yaml

   about:
     license_file: LICENSE.txt

In this case, please also notify the upstream developers that the license file is missing.

.. important::

  The license should only be shipped along with the recipe if there is no license file in the downloaded archive.
  If there is a license file in the archive, please set ``license_file`` to the path of the license file in the archive.

.. _spdx:

SPDX Identifiers and Expressions
................................

For the ``about: license`` entry in the recipe ``meta.yaml``, using a SPDX identifier or expression is recommended.

See `SPDX license identifiers <https://spdx.org/licenses/>`__ for the licenses.
See `SPDX license exceptions <https://spdx.org/licenses/exceptions-index.html>`__ for license exceptions.
See `SPDX specification <https://spdx.org/spdx-specification-21-web-version>`__ Appendix IV
for the specification on expressions.

.. code-block:: none

   Apache-2.0
   Apache-2.0 WITH LLVM-exception
   BSD-3-Clause
   BSD-3-Clause OR MIT
   GPL-2.0-or-later
   LGPL-2.0-only OR GPL-2.0-only
   LicenseRef-HDF5
   MIT
   MIT AND BSD-2-Clause
   PSF-2.0


Miscellaneous
=============

Activate scripts
----------------

Recipes are allowed to have activate scripts, which will be ``source``\ d or
``call``\ ed when the environment is activated. It is generally recommended to avoid using
activate scripts when another option is possible because people do not always
activate environments the expected way and these packages may then misbehave.

When using them in a recipe, feel free to name them ``activate.bat``,
``activate.sh``, ``deactivate.bat``, and ``deactivate.sh`` in the recipe. The
installed scripts are recommended to be prefixed by the package name and a
separating ``-``. Below is some sample code for Unix and Windows that will make
this install process easier. Please feel free to lift it.

In ``build.sh``:

.. code-block:: bash

    # Copy the [de]activate scripts to $PREFIX/etc/conda/[de]activate.d.
    # This will allow them to be run on environment activation.
    for CHANGE in "activate" "deactivate"
    do
        mkdir -p "${PREFIX}/etc/conda/${CHANGE}.d"
        cp "${RECIPE_DIR}/${CHANGE}.sh" "${PREFIX}/etc/conda/${CHANGE}.d/${PKG_NAME}_${CHANGE}.sh"
    done

In ``build.bat``:

.. code-block:: batch

    setlocal EnableDelayedExpansion

    :: Copy the [de]activate scripts to %PREFIX%\etc\conda\[de]activate.d.
    :: This will allow them to be run on environment activation.
    for %%F in (activate deactivate) DO (
        if not exist %PREFIX%\etc\conda\%%F.d mkdir %PREFIX%\etc\conda\%%F.d
        copy %RECIPE_DIR%\%%F.bat %PREFIX%\etc\conda\%%F.d\%PKG_NAME%_%%F.bat
        :: Copy unix shell activation scripts, needed by Windows Bash users
        copy %RECIPE_DIR%\%%F.sh %PREFIX%\etc\conda\%%F.d\%PKG_NAME%_%%F.sh
    )

Jinja templating
----------------

The recipe ``meta.yaml`` can contain expressions that are evaluated during build time.
These expressions are written in `Jinja <http://jinja.pocoo.org/>`__ syntax.

Jinja expressions serve following purposes in the meta.yaml:

- They allow defining variables to avoid code duplication. Using a variable for the ``version`` allows changing the version only once with every update.

  .. code-block:: yaml

      {% set version = "3.7.3" %}
       [...]

      package:
        name: python
        version: {{ version }}

      source:
        url: https://www.python.org/ftp/python/{{ version }}/Python-{{ version }}.tar.xz
        sha256: da60b54064d4cfcd9c26576f6df2690e62085123826cff2e667e72a91952d318

- They can call `conda-build functions <https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda-build/en/latest/resources/define-metadata.html#conda-build-specific-jinja2-functions>`__ for automatic code generation. Examples are the compilers, cdt packages or the ``pin_compatible`` function.

  .. code-block:: yaml

    requirements:
      build:
        - {{ compiler('c') }}
        - {{ compiler('cxx') }}
        - {{ cdt('xorg-x11-proto-devel') }}  # [linux]
        - {{ cdt('libx11-devel') }}          # [linux]

  or

  .. code-block:: yaml

    requirements:
      build:
        - {{ compiler('c') }}
        - {{ compiler('cxx') }}
      host:
        - python
        - numpy
      run:
        - python
        - {{ pin_compatible('numpy') }}



For more information please refer to the `Templating with Jinja <https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda-build/en/latest/resources/define-metadata.html#templating-with-jinja>`__ section in the conda-build docs.
