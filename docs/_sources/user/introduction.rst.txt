A brief introduction
====================

What is conda-forge?
--------------------

conda-forge is a community effort that provides conda packages for a wide range of software.

**Missing a package that you would love to install with conda?** - Chances are we have already packaged it for you!

You can `search <https://anaconda.org/>`__ for packages online. Look out for packages provided by our ``conda-forge`` organization.

**Cannot find a package or only outdated versions of a package?** - Everybody is welcome to contribute to our package stack! Please refer to :ref:`becoming_involved`, for an overview on how to start contributing.


Why conda-forge?
----------------

The conda team from Anaconda, Inc packages a multitude of packages and provides them to all users free of charge in their ``default`` channel.

But what if a package you are looking for is not in the default channel?
In the past users only had the option to create an `Anaconda Cloud <https://anaconda.org/>`__ account and create their own channel.

This came with a list of disadvantages:

 - locating packages was difficult due to them being scattered over many channels.
 - combining packages across channels was not always possible due to binary incompatibilities.
 - packages were only available for architectures the developer was interested in or had access to. 
 - channels were often abandoned, updating required locating new channels

conda-forge is a community effort that tackles these issues:

 - all packages are shared in a single channel named ``conda-forge``.
 - care is taken that all packages are up-to-date.
 - common standards ensure that all packages have compatible versions.
 - by default, we build packages for macOS, Linux AMD64 and Windows AMD64.
 - many packages are updated by multiple maintainers with an easy option to become a maintainer.
 - an active core developer team is trying to also maintain abandoned packages.



How can I install packages from conda-forge?
--------------------------------------------

Using conda-forge is easy!

 - Make sure you have ``conda >=4.9``.
 
 .. code-block:: bash

  conda --version
  conda update conda
  
 - Add ``conda-forge`` as the highest priority channel. 
 
 .. code-block:: bash

  conda config --add channels conda-forge
  
 - Activate ``strict`` channel priority (``strict`` will be activated by default in conda 5.0).
 
 .. code-block:: bash

  conda config --set channel_priority strict


From now on using ``conda install <package-name>`` will also find packages in our conda-forge channels.

.. note::

  In addition to the channel priority,
  we recommend always installing your packages inside a new environment instead of the ``base`` (formerly known as ``root``) environment,
  and we also recommend the use of ``miniconda`` instead of the Anaconda Distribution.
  Using environments make it easier to debug problems with packages and ensure the stability of your ``base`` environment.
  Avoiding the Anaconda Distribution reduces chances of unsolvable/conflicting installations, it is also a smaller download.

.. note::

  Please be aware that the order of your conda package channels is important, especially when you combine conda-forge with other channels, e.g. ``bioconda``.
  
.. note::

  `Miniforge <https://github.com/conda-forge/miniforge>`__ is a community
  effort to provide Miniconda-like installers, with the added feature that
  conda-forge is the default channel.
  For certain platforms (such as ARMv8 64-bit, formally known as `aarch64`)
  Anaconda, Inc. does not provide any Miniconda installers, however Miniforge
  does.
  Miniforge installers are available here: https://github.com/conda-forge/miniforge/#download

  Please refer to :ref:`multiple_channels` for pitfalls and more information.



Display conda-forge packages in Anaconda Navigator
------------------------------------------------------------

#. Open **Anaconda Navigator** by running ``anaconda-navigator``
#. Go to the **Environments** tab.
#. Click the **Channels** button.
#. Click the **Add** button.
#. Enter the channel url ``https://conda.anaconda.org/conda-forge/``
#. Press the **Enter key** on your keyboard.
#. Click the **Update channels** button.

From now on, whenever the **package filter** is set to **All** on the Environments tab, all conda-forge packages will be displayed.
