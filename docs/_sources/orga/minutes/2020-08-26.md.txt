## Attendees
 
## Agenda

### Standing items

* [x] intros for new folks on the call
* [x] (CJ) budget
    * current approvals are all up to date.
    * screenshare and show the doc monthly?

### Your new agenda items

stuff from last time

* [x] (MRB) shall we merge this (https://github.com/conda-forge/conda-forge.github.io/pull/1139)?
    * PR is on supported python versions
    * waiting on isuru

* [x] (ED) Sylvain: Any updates from OVH on the windows VM?
    * TODO: keep checking in on this
    * OVH will want their brand on our page somewhere.
    * TODO
        * [ ] (???) build webpage to credit them (and others)
        * If we're adding a logo, will want to make sure that we have permission to use it.
        * Shout-out on twitter at some point. "Thanks forOVHCloud for providing a VM", etc. (maybe after we ship qt on windows with it?)

* [x] (AS) qgpu - GPU build agents. 
    * Drone or Azure? Drone is a simple go executable and you can run it in docker. Azure build agent is heavy weight?
    * Pick one and go
    * Waiting on Anthony to have some spare time.
    * JH: Github actions has a runner
    * AS: Happy to try any and all solutions
    * MRB: Rerendering can't push changes to workflow files in feedstocks. There's not a feasible workaround for this atm. Currently working with github on trying to fix this, but it's not going quickly.

new stuff

* [x] (MRB, John) docker hub changes
    * by default they will limit pulls of our images to a few hundred per hour for anonymous users
        * https://www.docker.com/blog/scaling-docker-to-serve-millions-more-developers-network-egress/
        * HN: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=24262757
        * https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=24268336
        > Github Docker Registry is a mess and should be avoided at all costs.
        > 1) It is broken and unusable on Kubernetes and Docker Swarm.
        > 2) It is flaky often returning 500 type errors.
        > 3) It is expensive as the amount of pull bandwidth is very limited.
    * this is based on the user pulling the image, not the user hosting the image
    * John put in an application for their open source program. Once we are accepted, they will work with 
      us hopefully.
        * (JK) Check in on Azure build workers and see if they have the docker hub limitation
    * For now, we should start trying to host our images elsewhere
        * Isuru suggested using github packages
        * we have used quay in the past
    * going to take a many pronged approach
        * [ ] (JK) Check in on Azure build workers and see if they have the docker hub limitation
        * [ ] (JK) work with dockerhub
        * [ ] (???) start pushing images to quay (github?)
        * [ ] (???) put changes in smithy to make sure we can use those other image locations
    

* [x] (MRB) AWS stuff submitted
    * we asked for 2k total from NumFocus through their pool of credits.
    * working through back and forth...
    * NumFocus is going to put our AWS account under theirs 

* [x] (KK) Conda virtual packages plugin
    * From the NVIDIA / RAPIDS side, desire to build more conda packages on things that depend on drivers with kernel modules, i.e. MOFED
        * (KK) MOFED is basically infiniband drivers. This is not the only case for this
    * Work to do on conda side to build plugin architecture to support this
        * https://github.com/conda/conda/issues/10131 (currently slated for 5.0.0 release)
    * Could potentially explode build matrices for certain projects, what is our stance from the conda-forge side?

    * Lingering comment from @saraedum. @jakirkham, can you reply? Has unadressed comment from @saraedum from Jan 8, 2020
    * (MRB) The stalebot has solved the worst of the issues here. I think we could defer this one permanently.

* [cfep-10](https://github.com/conda-forge/conda-forge-enhancement-proposals/pull/15) Feedstock statuses, unmaintained
    * INACTIVE - Merge in with some inactive-esque status?
    * Needs another review. Has unaddressed updates from pkgw as of Jan 11, 2020

    * Stalled since May 26, 2020
    * Active debate about moving to "broken" vs deleting from conda-forge channel
    * Active vote, ends on 2020-03-11
    * What were the results of the vote?
    * Did we hear back from NumFOCUS?

* [cfep-17](https://github.com/conda-forge/cfep/pull/32) Handling pin backports and dependency rebuilds
    * Stalled debate about implementation details between Isuru, CJ and Matt
    * **UPDATE 2020-07-22**: We in principle have agreement to render the extra pinnings needed directly in the feedstock 
      on a temporary basis (i.e., until the migration has ended).
