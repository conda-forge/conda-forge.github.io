We\ndo employ extensive changes to project build scripts in order to properly build and install projects into conda environments.\nFinally, in some cases we add, enable, or disable features in specific projects to ensure they are broadly compatible with the\nconda-forge package set. The set of patches/changes we apply is always located in the feedstock that built the package. We\nalso maintain a list of important packages with changes in our documentation."})]})}function h(e={}){const{wrapper:n}={...(0,t.R)(),...e.components};return n?(0,o.jsx)(n,{...e,children:(0,o.jsx)(c,{...e})}):c(e)}},28453:(e,n,a)=>{a.d(n,{R:()=>s,x:()=>r});var i=a(96540);const o={},t=i.createContext(o);function s(e){const n=i.useContext(t);return i.useMemo((function(){return"function"==typeof e?e(n):{...n,...e}}),[n,e])}function r(e){let n;return n=e.disableParentContext?"function"==typeof e.components?e.components(o):e.components||o:s(e.components),i.createElement(t.Provider,{value:n},e.children)}}}]);
