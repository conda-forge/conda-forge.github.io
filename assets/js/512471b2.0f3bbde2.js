In the past, this was handled by a change to the\nglobal pinnings and a subsequent migration via the auto-tick bot. While\nthis worked, there were issues that this created. Firstly, this approach\ncould cause unsatisfiable build dependencies for new packages, as some\nof the new package's dependencies had been compiled with the new pins,\nbut not all.
