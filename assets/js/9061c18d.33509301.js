Some extra extensions were responsible for the other parts of the website; e.g. the [blog](https://github.com/conda-forge/blog), the [RSS feed](https://github.com/conda-forge/conda-forge.github.io/tree/1d3214c295a46a249434de4fcf48c6b8d747a07f/newsfeed), the [frontpage](https://github.com/conda-forge/conda-forge.github.io/blob/1d3214c295a46a249434de4fcf48c6b8d747a07f/index.html.tmpl), [feedstock outputs](https://github.com/conda-forge/conda-forge.github.io/blob/1d3214c295a46a249434de4fcf48c6b8d747a07f/feedstock_outputs.html.tmpl), or the [status page](https://github.com/conda-forge/status/tree/bde62db0bc9de460f533d60ca6218604c3e42fa5/site).\\n\\nThe new website has been rewritten using the [Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io/) project. This allows us to have a single framework for all the sections of the site. There are some big differences if we compare the new site with the old one:\\n\\n- Sphinx was written in Python. Docusaurus uses the Node.js stack.\\n- Most of our docs were written in RST. Docusaurus handles Markdown and MDX (Markdown + JSX).\\n- Instead of generating static HTML from Jinja templates, we now prefer fetching the JSON payloads and render the relevant pages at build time (i.e. when we run `npm run build`) or at load time (when the user visits the website). This allows to have all the website rendering logic in the same repository with a unified theme, search engine and statistics.\\n\\n## What we have changed\\n\\n- The theme for the whole site is responsive, accessible, mobile friendly and supports dark/light modes. A style guide is available too.\\n- The Status dashboard fetches data dynamically and provides detailed views for each migration.\\n- The Packages section lists latest updates in addition to mapping packages to feedstocks.\\n- A new Download page displays links to the latest Miniforge installers.\\n- The documentation has been split in two top-level categories: Docs and Community.\\n- Algolia generously serves the backend for the search bar.\\n- Netlify will render previews on each opened PR for a smoother contribution process.\\n- The blog posts and the announcements feed are served natively by Docusaurus.\\n- We converted all the Sphinx-native ReStructuredText documents to Docusaurus-friendly Markdown.\\n- The conda-forge.yml docs are autogenerated from the conda-smithy schemas.\\n- ... and a bunch of smaller changes in the documentation.

Use the <kbd>Cmd/Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>K</kbd> shortcut for faster access.\\n- The [Status dashboard](/status) will inform you about the latest incidents and ongoing migrations. Each migration has now a permalink you can explore and share!\\n- The [Packages](/packages) section will help you find all the packages in conda-forge. If you don\'t type anything in the search bar, it will list the last 100 uploads to the Anaconda.org channel.

However, to avoid\\nbreaking users on older systems, we need to have infrastructure in place that\\nallows our packages to have sufficiently accurate metadata, such that conda can\\navoid the installation of a package requiring a newer stdlib on an old system.\\n\\nAfter many discussions across conda-forge stakeholders, the solution we arrived\\nat is the introduction of a new Jinja2-function `{{ stdlib(\\"c\\") }}`, which\\nreflects that a given recipe requires a C stdlib.

As for some general rules that\\nall feedstock maintainers are free to apply independently:\\n\\n- if a feedstock uses a `- {{ compiler(...) }}` jinja in the build section,\\n  add a line with `- {{ stdlib(\\"c\\") }}` to the build environment.\\n- if a feedstock uses `- sysroot_linux-64 2.17  # [linux64]` (or a variation),\\n  remove this line and add the following to your `conda_build_config.yaml`:\\n  ```\\n  c_stdlib_version:              # [linux]\\n    - 2.17                       # [linux]\\n  ```\\n- if a feedstock sets `MACOSX_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET` in `conda_build_config.yaml`,\\n  for example to 10.13 for `x86_64`, replace that section with the following\\n  (note, this does _not_ apply to `MACOSX_SDK_VERSION`!):\\n  ```\\n  c_stdlib_version:              # [osx and x86_64]\\n    - 10.13                      # [osx and x86_64]\\n  ```\\n- In `meta.yaml`, you can then remove any variations of `- __glibc >=2.17` or\\n  `- __osx >={{ MACOSX_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET }}  # [osx and x86_64]`, as this will\\n  henceforth be handled through `- {{ stdlib(\\"c\\") }}`.\\n\\nFollowing the application of any of the above changes, the feedstock should be\\n[rerendered](https://conda-forge.org/docs/maintainer/updating_pkgs/#rerendering-feedstocks).\\n\\nAs these mechanisms begin rolling out, we will also update the maintainer\\ndocumentation in the conda-forge knowledge base.
