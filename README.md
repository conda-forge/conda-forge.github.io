## Improving the docs

- You can help to improve the documentation! It is version-controlled in the [conda-forge.github.io repository on GitHub](https://github.com/conda-forge/conda-forge.github.io).

- The docs are built on GitHub Actions and run the `.ci_scripts/update_docs` script.
  We are glad to know that you would like to contribute. To build the docs locally, follow the steps mentioned below:

1.  [Fork](https://docs.github.com/en/github/getting-started-with-github/fork-a-repo) the [conda-forge.github.io](https://github.com/conda-forge/conda-forge.github.io) repository to your own GitHub user account.
2.  [Clone](https://docs.github.com/en/github/creating-cloning-and-archiving-repositories/cloning-a-repository) this fork onto your computer.
3.  Go into the main folder.
    Run the following commands.
      *  `conda env create -f ./.ci_scripts/environment.yml`
      *  `conda activate conda-forge-docs`
      * For live builds, `npm install && npm run start`
      * For production builds, run `.ci_scripts/update_docs`
4.  Make and commit your changes.
5.  Submit a [pull request](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/about-pull-requests) to the main repository proposing your changes.

## Code of conduct

We at conda-forge adhere to the [NumFOCUS Code of Conduct](https://numfocus.org/code-of-conduct):

> * Be kind to others. Do not insult or put down others. Behave professionally. Remember that harassment and sexist, racist, or exclusionary jokes are not appropriate for conda-forge.
>
> * All communication should be appropriate for a professional audience, including people of many different backgrounds. Sexual language and imagery is not appropriate.
>
> * conda-forge is dedicated to providing a harassment-free community for everyone, regardless of gender, sexual orientation, gender identity and expression, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, or religion. We do not tolerate harassment of community members in any form.

Thank you for helping make this a welcoming, friendly community for all.

### Reporting guidelines

If you believe someone is violating the code of conduct, please report this in a timely manner. Code of conduct violations reduce the value of the community for everyone. The team at conda-forge takes reports of misconduct very seriously and is committed to preserving and maintaining the welcoming nature of our community.

Reports should be sent to <conda-forge-core@googlegroups.com>, a private mailing list only accessible by the members of the core team. If your report involves a member of the core team, please send it to NumFOCUS following [these instructions](https://numfocus.org/code-of-conduct#how-to-report).

All reports will be kept confidential. Please have a look at the [Reporting guidelines](https://numfocus.org/code-of-conduct#reporting-guidelines).

### Enforcement: What happens after a report is filed?

conda-forge's team and/or our event staff will try to ensure your safety and help with any immediate needs, particularly at an in-person event. Once we have received the report through the relevant authorities, conda-forge will make every effort to acknowledge the receipt and take action. Have a look at the process of [What Happens After a Report is Filed?](https://numfocus.org/code-of-conduct#enforcement).

## conda-forge dev meetings

We hold biweekly meetings every second Wednesday from 17:00-18:00 (UTC). Feel free to stop by!
Up-to-date invites are always available in the [conda.org community calendar](https://conda.org/community/calendar). Look for the `[conda-forge] core meeting` events!

Our [meeting notes](https://conda-forge.org/docs/orga/minutes/00_intro.html) record important points discussed during the meetings and serve as a record for upcoming meetings. We make use of [HackMd](https://hackmd.io/) and a [template](https://github.com/conda-forge/conda-forge.github.io/blob/main/misc/DEV_MEETING_TEMPLATE.md) to create the meeting notes.

We use a Github Actions [workflow][gha-workflow] to create an automated PR with the meeting notes
template for each session, which is automatically published to our HackMD team account. During the
meeting, attendees will edit the HackMD document. After the meeting, the document is saved and the
PR is synced with the changes by adding the `sync-hackmd-notes` label. Once satisfied, the PR is
merged and the website will be updated with the new meeting notes.

We encourage contributors to join the meetings and learn more about and from the community.
