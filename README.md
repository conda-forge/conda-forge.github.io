## Overview
This repository

- provides an [issue tracker](https://github.com/conda-forge/conda-forge.github.io/issues) for conda-forge related questions and issues that are **not specific to individual feedstocks**.

If you have questions or need help, please check out our documentation for a [list of ways to interact with us](https://conda-forge.org/docs/user/how_to_get_help.html).

## Improving the docs

- You can help to improve the documentation! It is version-controlled in the [conda-forge.github.io repository on GitHub](https://github.com/conda-forge/conda-forge.github.io).   The source text is stored in the src/ subdirectory and is formatted using Pythonâ€™s [reStructuredText system](https://docutils.sourceforge.io/rst.html).

- The docs are built on GitHub Actions and run the `.ci_scripts/update_docs` script.
  We are glad to know that you would like to contribute. To build the docs locally, follow the steps mentioned below:
1.  [Fork](https://docs.github.com/en/github/getting-started-with-github/fork-a-repo) the [conda-forge.github.io](https://github.com/conda-forge/conda-forge.github.io)        repository to your own GitHub user account.
2.  [Clone](https://docs.github.com/en/github/creating-cloning-and-archiving-repositories/cloning-a-repository) this fork onto your computer.

## conda-forge dev meetings

Our documentation contains a section with [minutes from previous dev meetings]([https://conda-forge.org/docs/minutes/00_intro.html]). These meetings occur every two weeks on Wednesday from 17:00-18:00 UTC.
A link to the google calendar item can be found [here](https://calendar.google.com/event?action=TEMPLATE&tmeid=bTk5ZzBoMDEzaW11cmZiNWJnNmNkbThocDRfMjAyMjA1MThUMTcwMDAwWiBlcmljQHZvbHRyb25kYXRhLmNvbQ&tmsrc=eric%40voltrondata.com&scp=ALL).

We use https://hackmd.io/ for taking meeting minutes and will (eventually) upload the resultant markdown file after the meeting has concluded.

There is a template provided in [`misc/DEV_MEETING_TEMPLATE.md`](https://github.com/conda-forge/conda-forge.github.io/tree/main/misc/DEV_MEETING_TEMPLATE.md) that you should use to create a new hackmd document.
