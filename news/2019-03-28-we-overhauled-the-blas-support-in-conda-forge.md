# We overhauled the blas support in conda-forge.

- Our packages now build against NETLIBâ€™s reference implementation.
- You as a user can now choose the implementation available at runtime.
  For more information please refer to the [documentation](/docs/maintainer/knowledge_base/#knowledge-blas).
