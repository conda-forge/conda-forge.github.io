        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>CUDA 11.8 is the last holdover from the old days before conda-forge
<a href="https://github.com/conda-forge/conda-forge.github.io/issues/1963" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="">switched</a>
to the new and shiny CUDA 12+ infrastructure, where the CUDA toolchain
is provided as native conda-packages, rather than a blob in an image.</p>
<p>For CUDA-enabled feedstocks, we've been building both 11.8 and 12.6 by default
for a while now, but many feedstocks (notably pytorch, tensorflow, onnx, jax etc.)
have dropped CUDA 11.8 for many months already.</p>
<p>Due to various constraints (details below), we are dropping CUDA 11.8 as a default
version in our global pinning on June 5th. It will still be possible to opt into
building CUDA 11.8 on a per-feedstock basis where this is necessary or beneficial.</p>
<p>The above-mentioned contraints are mainly:</p>
<ul>
<li class="">it <a href="https://github.com/conda-forge/conda-forge-pinning-feedstock/issues/6967" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="">complicates our pinning</a> due to needing to switch images and compilers with 11.8.</li>
<li class="">it keeps us from <a href="https://github.com/conda-forge/conda-forge-pinning-feedstock/pull/7005" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="">migrating</a>
to newer CUDA 12.x versions necessary to support new architectures.</li>
<li class="">it's <a href="https://github.com/conda-forge/conda-forge.github.io/issues/2138#issuecomment-2916743741" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="">not compatible with VS2022</a>, which is due to become the default toolchain on windows
in conda-forge soon (the previous VS2019 has reached end-of-life more than a year ago).</li>
<li class="">it complicates our infrastructure in several places, due to the big differences between the
before/after of the new CUDA architecture.</li>
</ul>
<p>After we have removed CUDA 11.8 from the pinning, any feedstock still building that version
will drop the respective CI jobs upon rerendering. For feedstocks wanting to keep building
CUDA 11.8 a bit longer, we have provided a custom migrator.</p>
<p>The way to make use of this is to copy
<a href="https://github.com/conda-forge/conda-forge-pinning-feedstock/blob/main/recipe/migrations/cuda118.yaml" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class=""><code>cuda118.yaml</code></a>
from the global pinning into <code>.ci_support/migrations</code> on your feedstock.
If the <code>migrations</code> subfolder doesn't exist, please create it. Once that's committed
(and there are no skips in the recipe for CUDA 11.8), rerendering the feedstock
will reinstate the builds for CUDA 11.8. If you have trouble with that, please open
a thread on <a href="https://conda-forge.zulipchat.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="">https://conda-forge.zulipchat.com/</a>.</p>
<p>Finally, please let us
know in the <a href="https://github.com/conda-forge/conda-forge-pinning-feedstock/issues/7404" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="">issue</a>
if your feedstock still needs to support CUDA 11.8 and why (later down the line we'll want to
drop support also in conda-forge-ci-setup, and knowing what feedstocks - if any - still need
CUDA 11.8 will help guide the decision on timing).</p>]]></content>

<p>Linux builds in conda-forge run on infrastructure derived from RHEL and its clones
-- previously CentOS, now AlmaLinux. Primarily we need this for four different
interrelated but distinct pieces:</p>
<ul>
<li class="">the docker images (containing the OS which will execute our builds)</li>
<li class="">the sysroot (mainly the C standard library, <code>glibc</code>)</li>
<li class="">the CDTs (pieces from the distribution we cannot package ourselves)</li>
<li class="">feedstock usage of <code>yum_requirements.txt</code></li>
</ul>
<p>A first key observation is that the glibc appears twice -- once explicitly in the
sysroot we package (and compile against!), and once implicitly in the image that
our CI runs on. This setup is essential to provide highly compatible packages by
default (by compiling against a cos7 baseline), while avoiding constant hassles
for feedstocks where <em>any</em> of the build/host/run dependencies requires a newer
glibc than the baseline.</p>
<p>This is because, for packages requiring a newer <code>c_stdlib_version</code> (and thus compiling
against a newer sysroot through the <code>{{ stdlib("c") }}</code> infrastructure), will inherit
a runtime-requirement of <code>__glibc &gt;=c_stdlib_version</code>, which would be unsatisfiable on
docker-images with a too-old glibc present at runtime.</p>
<p>We've already had this setup since 2021 (when our glibc baseline was 2.12 from cos6,
yet we already used cos7 images), but after increasing the glibc baseline to 2.17, our
images had lost their lead again. This is mostly related due to the third component from
above, the CDTs (core dependency trees). These represent packages from the distribution
itself that are hard or impossible for us to provide, yet need a systematic way to
interact with. You can read more about <em>why we want to avoid them as much as possible</em>
<a href="https://conda-forge.org/docs/maintainer/knowledge_base/#why-are-cdts-bad" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="">here</a>.</p>
<p>Due to the end of CentOS-as-we-knew it, we already had to rewrite a lot of the logic
there in any case to switch to Alma, which we took as an opportunity to pare down the
set of CDTs we provide going forward. In a large majority of cases, we have regular
conda packages for some things that only used to be available as CDTs.</p>
<p>CDTs and packages in <code>yum_requirements.txt</code> are closely related; in many ways it can
be considered a similar compilation-vs.-runtime split as is the case with our sysroot
(that we compile against) vs. the glibc in the image at runtime. The split here being
that CDTs are what we use to compile against a given distro package, and <code>yum_requirements.txt</code>
are how we tell the infrastructure to install them into the image, if they're also
necessary at runtime (which is not always the case).</p>
<p>In other words, using our own packages generally allows feedstocks to avoid <em>both</em> use
of CDTs and <code>yum_requirements.txt</code>. You can check out the CDTs we removed
<a href="https://github.com/conda-forge/cdt-builds/issues/66#issuecomment-1833417828" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="">here</a>
and how <code>yum_requirements.txt</code> translate from CentOS to Alma (resp. our own packages)
<a href="https://github.com/conda-forge/conda-forge-pinning-feedstock/issues/6283#issuecomment-2440281086" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="">here</a>.</p>
<p>The change of the image might mean that CDTs we have not repackaged for Alma do not
match what's actually in the image anymore, or -- in rare cases -- that a package name
under <code>yum_requirements.txt</code> needs to be updated. Please let us know if you run into
problems there (after checking out the two links above how to transition a given package).</p>
<p>Finally, there is one rare case where we explicitly ask feedstock authors to opt out
of the newest images: for any feedstocks doing binary repackaging on linux (i.e. not
compiling the package from source), please ensure that your image version (as specified
in <code>conda-forge.yml</code>, see above) matches the <code>c_stdlib_version</code> that you are using.
By default this is 2.17, which means you'd have to do</p>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>We have changed our feedstock output validation procedure. Instead of automatically
adding new packages to existing feedstocks (e.g., when a new output is added), we will now
require that maintainers submit a PR to add the new output via our
<a href="https://github.com/conda-forge/admin-requests?tab=readme-ov-file#add-a-package-output-to-a-feedstock" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="">admin-requests repository</a>.
New feedstocks created via <code>staged-recipes</code> will have their outputs added automatically. If you maintain a feedstock
that regularly adds new outputs (e.g., <code>llvmdev</code> has <code>libllvm18</code>, <code>libllvm19</code>, etc.), you can use the <code>admin-requsts</code> repo
to add a glob pattern that matches the pattern of your new outputs. We test these patterns aginst new outputs from the feedstock
using the Python <code>fnmatch</code> module. Outputs from the feedstock that match a glob pattern will added automatically. Further
details on package output validation can be found in our <a href="https://conda-forge.org/docs/maintainer/infrastructure/#output-validation-and-feedstock-tokens" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="">documentation</a>.</p>]]></content>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Starting with Python 3.13, <code>pip</code> will no longer have <code>setuptools</code> and <code>wheel</code> as dependencies
by default. While this default made sense at the time <code>conda-forge</code> was started (over 8 years ago!),
with the advent of Python packaging build backends (e.g., <code>flit</code>, <code>poetry</code>, <code>hatchling</code>, etc.),
this default is no longer correct. Instead, you will need to specify <code>wheel</code> and/or <code>setuptools</code> explicitly in the <code>host</code>
section of your recipe if you need them. At first, <code>pip</code> for versions of Python before 3.13 will be unaffected.
However, after the completion of the Python 3.13 migration, we will remove these dependencies from <code>pip</code> for all
versions of Python. Follow GitHub issue <a href="https://github.com/conda-forge/conda-forge.github.io/issues/2252" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="">#2252</a>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>TL;DR: We are planning to remove PyPy from conda-forge feedstock recipes in a
few weeks (and thus to stop building new releases of packages for PyPy), unless
there is substantial enough interest to justify the continued maintenance effort.</p>
<p>Conda-forge introduced <a href="https://conda-forge.org/blog/2020/03/10/pypy/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="">support</a>
for <a href="https://pypy.org/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="">PyPy</a> as an alternative implementation of
Python about 4.5 years ago.</p>
<p>In that time we have worked hard together with developers from PyPy to provide
easily installable pre-compiled builds of the most common libraries also for PyPy.</p>
<p>As a very positive side-effect, the infrastructure of conda-forge is now fully
equipped to deal with alternative implementations of the Python interpreter,
which will continue to be useful (for example for supporting the experimental
free-threading builds of CPython 3.13).</p>
<p>However, due to a lack of resources – both in terms of expertise for PyPy, as
well as available time of those who can help – the conda-forge builds for PyPy
packages have been in minimal maintenance for a while (for example, we never
migrated for PyPy 3.10, nor did PyPy participate in the NumPy 2.0 migration).</p>
<p>As a consequence, we unfortunately need to announce that we are sunsetting
support for PyPy. This means we will stop the long-running migrator to add
PyPy to new feedstocks, and we will begin removing PyPy builds from feedstocks
at the latest on October 1st, or when we begin migrating for CPython 3.13
(whichever comes earlier).</p>
<p>If you are depending on PyPy builds in some way, please let us know about the
specifics of your situation in the discussion issue for the
<a href="https://github.com/conda-forge/conda-forge.github.io/issues/2255" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="">RFC</a>.</p>
<p>There is a possibility that we receive the necessary support from the PyPy
developers, if it turns out that enough people depend on PyPy support in
conda-forge for it to be worth their time. As such, please speak up if you
fall into this category!</p>
<p>Finally, no matter the outcome, we want to congratulate the PyPy developers
for their important contributions and exploration of what is possible in the
Python ecosystem! 👏</p>
<p>It has been a pleasure to collaborate!</p>]]></content>

the Miniforge and Mambaforge installers became essentially <strong>identical</strong>. The only difference
between the two was their name and, subsequently, the default installation directory.</p>
<p>Maintaining both installers adds unnecessary burden to our support infrastructure and creates
confusion among end users. As a result, last year we decided to <em>discourage</em> the usage of
Mambaforge in favor of Miniforge.</p>
<p>A year later, we would like to formally sunset Mambaforge. All users are encouraged to switch to
Miniforge. Remember they contain the same packages, so the only difference is the default
installation directory.</p>
<p>The deprecation process will roughly follow this calendar:</p>
<ul>
<li class="">August 2024: The Mambaforge installers will warn about the deprecation and make the user wait 30
seconds before continuing.</li>
<li class="">October 2024: The Mambaforge installers will refuse to install during several pre-specified date ranges (i.e., <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brownout_(software_engineering)" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="">"brownouts"</a>) in order to encourage users to switch to Miniforge. These dates are
<ul>
<li class="">Every two weeks in October 2024 (2024-10-01, 2024-10-15)</li>
<li class="">Every ten days in November 2024 (2024-11-01, 2024-11-10, 2024-11-20, 2024-11-30)</li>
<li class="">Every five days in December 2024 (2024-12-05, 2024-12-10, 2024-12-15, 2024-12-20, 2024-12-25, 2024-12-30, 2024-12-31)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li class="">January 2025: The Mambaforge installers will stop being built and distributed.</li>
