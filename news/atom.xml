        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>We have changed our feedstock output validation procedure. Instead of automatically
adding new packages to existing feedstocks (e.g., when a new output is added), we will now
require that maintainers submit a PR to add the new output via our
<a href="https://github.com/conda-forge/admin-requests?tab=readme-ov-file#add-a-package-output-to-a-feedstock" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">admin-requests repository</a>.
New feedstocks created via <code>staged-recipes</code> will have their outputs added automatically. If you maintain a feedstock
that regularly adds new outputs (e.g., <code>llvmdev</code> has <code>libllvm18</code>, <code>libllvm19</code>, etc.), you can use the <code>admin-requsts</code> repo
to add a glob pattern that matches the pattern of your new outputs. We test these patterns aginst new outputs from the feedstock
using the Python <code>fnmatch</code> module. Outputs from the feedstock that match a glob pattern will added automatically. Further
details on package output validation can be found in our <a href="https://conda-forge.org/docs/maintainer/infrastructure/#output-validation-and-feedstock-tokens" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">documentation</a>.</p>]]></content>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Starting with Python 3.13, <code>pip</code> will no longer have <code>setuptools</code> and <code>wheel</code> as dependencies
by default. While this default made sense at the time <code>conda-forge</code> was started (over 8 years ago!),
with the advent of Python packaging build backends (e.g., <code>flit</code>, <code>poetry</code>, <code>hatchling</code>, etc.),
this default is no longer correct. Instead, you will need to specify <code>wheel</code> and/or <code>setuptools</code> explicitly in the <code>host</code>
section of your recipe if you need them. At first, <code>pip</code> for versions of Python before 3.13 will be unaffected.
However, after the completion of the Python 3.13 migration, we will remove these dependencies from <code>pip</code> for all
versions of Python. Follow GitHub issue <a href="https://github.com/conda-forge/conda-forge.github.io/issues/2252" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">#2252</a>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>TL;DR: We are planning to remove PyPy from conda-forge feedstock recipes in a
few weeks (and thus to stop building new releases of packages for PyPy), unless
there is substantial enough interest to justify the continued maintenance effort.</p>
<p>Conda-forge introduced <a href="https://conda-forge.org/blog/2020/03/10/pypy/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">support</a>
for <a href="https://pypy.org/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">PyPy</a> as an alternative implementation of
Python about 4.5 years ago.</p>
<p>In that time we have worked hard together with developers from PyPy to provide
easily installable pre-compiled builds of the most common libraries also for PyPy.</p>
<p>As a very positive side-effect, the infrastructure of conda-forge is now fully
equipped to deal with alternative implementations of the Python interpreter,
which will continue to be useful (for example for supporting the experimental
free-threading builds of CPython 3.13).</p>
<p>However, due to a lack of resources – both in terms of expertise for PyPy, as
well as available time of those who can help – the conda-forge builds for PyPy
packages have been in minimal maintenance for a while (for example, we never
migrated for PyPy 3.10, nor did PyPy participate in the NumPy 2.0 migration).</p>
<p>As a consequence, we unfortunately need to announce that we are sunsetting
support for PyPy. This means we will stop the long-running migrator to add
PyPy to new feedstocks, and we will begin removing PyPy builds from feedstocks
at the latest on October 1st, or when we begin migrating for CPython 3.13
(whichever comes earlier).</p>
<p>If you are depending on PyPy builds in some way, please let us know about the
specifics of your situation in the discussion issue for the
<a href="https://github.com/conda-forge/conda-forge.github.io/issues/2255" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">RFC</a>.</p>
<p>There is a possibility that we receive the necessary support from the PyPy
developers, if it turns out that enough people depend on PyPy support in
conda-forge for it to be worth their time. As such, please speak up if you
fall into this category!</p>
<p>Finally, no matter the outcome, we want to congratulate the PyPy developers
for their important contributions and exploration of what is possible in the
Python ecosystem! 👏</p>
<p>It has been a pleasure to collaborate!</p>]]></content>

the Miniforge and Mambaforge installers became essentially <strong>identical</strong>. The only difference
between the two was their name and, subsequently, the default installation directory.</p>
<p>Maintaining both installers adds unnecessary burden to our support infrastructure and creates
confusion among end users. As a result, last year we decided to <em>discourage</em> the usage of
Mambaforge in favor of Miniforge.</p>
<p>A year later, we would like to formally sunset Mambaforge. All users are encouraged to switch to
Miniforge. Remember they contain the same packages, so the only difference is the default
installation directory.</p>
<p>The deprecation process will roughly follow this calendar:</p>
<ul>
<li>August 2024: The Mambaforge installers will warn about the deprecation and make the user wait 30
seconds before continuing.</li>
<li>October 2024: The Mambaforge installers will refuse to install during several pre-specified date ranges (i.e., <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brownout_(software_engineering)" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">"brownouts"</a>) in order to encourage users to switch to Miniforge. These dates are
<ul>
<li>Every two weeks in October 2024 (2024-10-01, 2024-10-15)</li>
<li>Every ten days in November 2024 (2024-11-01, 2024-11-10, 2024-11-20, 2024-11-30)</li>
<li>Every five days in December 2024 (2024-12-05, 2024-12-10, 2024-12-15, 2024-12-20, 2024-12-25, 2024-12-30, 2024-12-31)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>January 2025: The Mambaforge installers will stop being built and distributed.</li>

<p>The new website has been rewritten using the <a href="https://docusaurus.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Docusaurus</a> project. This allows us to have a single framework for all the sections of the site. There are some big differences if we compare the new site with the old one:</p>
<ul>
<li>Sphinx was written in Python. Docusaurus uses the Node.js stack.</li>
<li>Most of our docs were written in RST. Docusaurus handles Markdown and MDX (Markdown + JSX).</li>
<li>Instead of generating static HTML from Jinja templates, we now prefer fetching the JSON payloads and render the relevant pages at build time (i.e. when we run <code>npm run build</code>) or at load time (when the user visits the website). This allows to have all the website rendering logic in the same repository with a unified theme, search engine and statistics.</li>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Almost since the inception of conda-forge, the baseline version of our standard]]></summary>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Almost since the inception of conda-forge, the baseline version of our standard
library ("stdlib") for C has not changed. This library comes with extra
complications because it is an essential part of the operating system, and one
of the few things that conda/mamba/etc. cannot ship safely.</p>
<p>As the ecosystem has moved on and many packages are starting to require newer
baseline versions, we need to follow suit at some point. However, to avoid
breaking users on older systems, we need to have infrastructure in place that
allows our packages to have sufficiently accurate metadata, such that conda can
avoid the installation of a package requiring a newer stdlib on an old system.</p>
<p>After many discussions across conda-forge stakeholders, the solution we arrived
at is the introduction of a new Jinja2-function <code>{{ stdlib("c") }}</code>, which
reflects that a given recipe requires a C stdlib. Making this relationship
explicit will make it easy to correctly reflect the requirement for newer
stdlib versions per feedstock, as well as in our global pinning.</p>
<p>Up until now, the stdlib was handled implicitly as part of the compiler stack.
In order to allow this transition to happen, we need to introduce this function
to essentially all compiled recipes. This will be done in stages, first for a
single migration, and then attached to <em>all</em> ongoing migrations in conda-forge.</p>
<p>The logic of the piggyback migrator tries to correctly handle most scenarios,
but it is impossible to cover all corner cases. As for some general rules that
all feedstock maintainers are free to apply independently:</p>
<ul>
<li>if a feedstock uses a <code>- {{ compiler(...) }}</code> jinja in the build section,
add a line with <code>- {{ stdlib("c") }}</code> to the build environment.</li>
<li>if a feedstock uses <code>- sysroot_linux-64 2.17  # [linux64]</code> (or a variation),
remove this line and add the following to your <code>conda_build_config.yaml</code>:
<div class="codeBlockContainer_Ckt0 theme-code-block" style="--prism-color:#393A34;--prism-background-color:#f6f8fa"><div class="codeBlockContent_biex"><pre tabindex="0" class="prism-code language-text codeBlock_bY9V thin-scrollbar" style="color:#393A34;background-color:#f6f8fa"><code class="codeBlockLines_e6Vv"><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain">c_stdlib_version:              # [linux]</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain">  - 2.17                       # [linux]</span><br></span></code></pre><div class="buttonGroup__atx"><button type="button" aria-label="Copy code to clipboard" title="Copy" class="clean-btn"><span class="copyButtonIcons_eSgA" aria-hidden="true"><svg viewBox="0 0 24 24" class="copyButtonIcon_y97N"><path fill="currentColor" d="M19,21H8V7H19M19,5H8A2,2 0 0,0 6,7V21A2,2 0 0,0 8,23H19A2,2 0 0,0 21,21V7A2,2 0 0,0 19,5M16,1H4A2,2 0 0,0 2,3V17H4V3H16V1Z"></path></svg><svg viewBox="0 0 24 24" class="copyButtonSuccessIcon_LjdS"><path fill="currentColor" d="M21,7L9,19L3.5,13.5L4.91,12.09L9,16.17L19.59,5.59L21,7Z"></path></svg></span></button></div></div></div>
</li>
<li>if a feedstock sets <code>MACOSX_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET</code> in <code>conda_build_config.yaml</code>,
for example to 10.13 for <code>x86_64</code>, replace that section with the following
(note, this does <em>not</em> apply to <code>MACOSX_SDK_VERSION</code>!):
<div class="codeBlockContainer_Ckt0 theme-code-block" style="--prism-color:#393A34;--prism-background-color:#f6f8fa"><div class="codeBlockContent_biex"><pre tabindex="0" class="prism-code language-text codeBlock_bY9V thin-scrollbar" style="color:#393A34;background-color:#f6f8fa"><code class="codeBlockLines_e6Vv"><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain">c_stdlib_version:              # [osx and x86_64]</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain">  - 10.13                      # [osx and x86_64]</span><br></span></code></pre><div class="buttonGroup__atx"><button type="button" aria-label="Copy code to clipboard" title="Copy" class="clean-btn"><span class="copyButtonIcons_eSgA" aria-hidden="true"><svg viewBox="0 0 24 24" class="copyButtonIcon_y97N"><path fill="currentColor" d="M19,21H8V7H19M19,5H8A2,2 0 0,0 6,7V21A2,2 0 0,0 8,23H19A2,2 0 0,0 21,21V7A2,2 0 0,0 19,5M16,1H4A2,2 0 0,0 2,3V17H4V3H16V1Z"></path></svg><svg viewBox="0 0 24 24" class="copyButtonSuccessIcon_LjdS"><path fill="currentColor" d="M21,7L9,19L3.5,13.5L4.91,12.09L9,16.17L19.59,5.59L21,7Z"></path></svg></span></button></div></div></div>
</li>
<li>In <code>meta.yaml</code>, you can then remove any variations of <code>- __glibc &gt;=2.17</code> or
<code>- __osx &gt;={{ MACOSX_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET }}  # [osx and x86_64]</code>, as this will
henceforth be handled through <code>- {{ stdlib("c") }}</code>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Following the application of any of the above changes, the feedstock should be
<a href="https://conda-forge.org/docs/maintainer/updating_pkgs/#rerendering-feedstocks" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">rerendered</a>.</p>
<p>As these mechanisms begin rolling out, we will also update the maintainer
documentation in the conda-forge knowledge base. For more details, see this

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Conda-forge is dropping support for CUDA 11.2.</p>
<p>The latest version of the CUDA 11 series is CUDA 11.8. At this point CUDA 11.8+
is well-supported in conda-forge. This is a result of running extensive
migration efforts to upgrade conda-forge feedstocks to newer CUDA versions.</p>
<p>CUDA 11.8 packages can be installed and run on the same hardware that CUDA 11.2
supports. Also CUDA 11.8 packages have optimizations for newer hardware that
CUDA 11.2 packages do not. So there is a benefit to users to upgrade to CUDA
11.8.</p>
<p>A very small number of feedstocks that appear unmaintained have not been
migrated. Issues have been raised on those feedstock to make maintainers aware
of this deprecation plan. Until they are updated users can still install the
CUDA 11.2 packages they produced previously. These should continue to work.
However there will be no way to rebuild these packages without also updating to
CUDA 11.8.</p>
<p>To upgrade an older feedstock to CUDA 11.8, simply re-render. If the recipe has
a <code>skip</code> or other logic that blocks this from happening, simply remove this
logic and re-render to add CUDA 11.8.</p>
<p>The date has been sent to ensure 1 full work week for maintainers to do any
remaining updates to move to CUDA 11.8+. In 2024 May, <a href="https://gitlab.com/nvidia/container-images/cuda/-/issues/209#note_1641845842" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">NVIDIA plans to delete
the CUDA 11.2 Docker image</a>
that conda-forge has been using to build for CUDA 11.2. So it will not be
possible for conda-forge to update the CUDA 11.2 Docker image, which will make
it much harder to maintain. Feedstock maintainers are encouraged to update
before then (if they have not already done so).</p>]]></content>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>With the Python 3.12 release approaching, we have already started the
rebuild of packages for it. Although, there is no offical Python 3.12
release yet, the release candidates of it will have the same ABI. Thus
packages built with the release candidate can be safely used with the
later offical release. To support rebuilding packages on conda-forge
while ensuring Python release candidates don't end up in end-user
solves, we have uploaded the Python 3.12.0rc2 and rc3 builds to the
<code>conda-forge/label/python_rc</code> channel. The <code>python312</code> migration adds
this channel in the feedstock builds to the Python 3.12 matrix entry. On
the offical release of Python 3.12, we will adjust the migration and
remove the channel again. Then (on a rerender), feedstock will only
consume the main channel again.</p>
<p>Overall, this approach allows us to provide Python 3.12 for a wide range
of packages already on the day of the offical Python 3.12 release.
At the same time, we have stopped the Python 3.11 migration and added it
to the list of default Python versions on conda-forge.</p>]]></content>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>We will bump the minimum MacOS version from 10.9 (released in Oct. 2013,
end-of-life since Dec. 2016) to 10.13 (released Sept. 2017, end-of-life
since Dec. 2020). The main reason we managed to support 10.9 this long
at all, is that conda-forge is able to ship an up-to-date C++ standard
library for OSX, <code>libcxx</code>, superseding the old one present in the MacOS
SDK on the system (at least from the point-of-view of the respective
conda environments).</p>
<p>However, several core packages in the ecosystem now require at least
10.13 (or will very soon), in a way that we cannot be circumvent. These
packages include <code>libcxx</code>,
<a href="https://discourse.llvm.org/t/libc-bumping-minimal-deployment-target-for-building-the-dylib-static-library-on-macos/68912" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">starting</a>
with version 17.0. This change will not affect already published
artifacts, but in the near future, all new builds for OSX will require
at least 10.13. This constraint will be implemented through the <code>__osx</code>
virtual package, but the details of how we will achieve this are still
being worked out. Only <code>conda</code> versions 4.8.0 or newer have this virtual
package. If you are using a system with MacOS older than 10.13 and are
using <code>conda</code> older than 4.8.0, you will need to either upgrade <code>conda</code>
to at least 4.8.0 or upgrade your system to at least MacOS 10.13.</p>]]></content>
