# New time available for conda-forge core meetings

The core team has decided to change the time when core meetings happen to accommodate more attendees across different timezones. It will still happen every two Wednesdays, but starting next Wednesday, November 13th 2024, it will alternate between 17:00-18:00 UTC and 14:00-15:00 UTC.

For clarity, these are the next dates:

- November 13th, 2024 at 17:00 UTC
- November 27th, 2024 at 14:00 UTC
- December 11th, 2024 at 17:00 UTC
- ~~December 25th, 2024 at 14:00 UTC~~
- January 8th, 2025, at 17:00 UTC
- ... and so on.

A new calendar is now available in the [Community > Meetings](/community/meetings/) section to help find the dates.
