# NumPy 2 migration

In preparation for the NumPy 2 release, we have begun a migration of all
conda-forge packages that depend on `numpy` during the build (so in
`requirements/host`). The migration status is tracked
[on our status page](https://conda-forge.org/status/migration/numpy2).
Particular package's status can be found there. Specific recommendations for
maintainers updating packages can be found in the migration PRs themselves.
Please reach out through the usual channels if you have any questions.
