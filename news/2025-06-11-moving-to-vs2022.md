# Moving to Visual Studio 2022 as default windows compiler

Microsoft's Visual Studio (VS) 2019 compiler has reached its
[end of life](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/lifecycle/products/visual-studio-2019)
over a year ago. In the meantime, several projects have moved on and
fail to compile with VS2019.

We are planning to update our default compilers on windows to the (fully compatible)
successor VS2022 in one week from now.

This will not affect you as a general user of conda-forge packages on windows;
the only potential impact is that if you are compiling locally with VS2019 against
artefacts produced by conda-forge, you might be required to upgrade.

For more details see https://github.com/conda-forge/conda-forge.github.io/issues/2138.
