# Moving to Zulip

Two weeks ago we called a [vote](https://github.com/conda-forge/cfep/pull/54) on [CFEP-23](https://github.com/conda-forge/cfep/blob/main/cfep-23.md) to decide whether we move our [Element/Matrix chat rooms](https://matrix.to/#/#conda-forge:matrix.org) to Zulip. 

This vote has passed and now we are opening the doors to our Zulip instance: https://conda-forge.zulipchat.com/. Please sign up to stay in touch!

As per [CFEP-23](https://github.com/conda-forge/cfep/blob/main/cfep-23.md) (read it for more details), this means that we will stop using our [Element chat rooms](https://matrix.to/#/#conda-forge:matrix.org). Instead all chat activity will continue in Zulip.
