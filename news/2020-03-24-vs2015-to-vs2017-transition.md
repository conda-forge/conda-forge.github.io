# ``vs2015`` to ``vs2017`` Transition

We are formally deprecating `vs2015` in two weeks on 2020-04-07 and will
move to `vs2017`. This change will enable us to support the usage of
`msbuild` on Azure for the `win` platform and will provide additional
support for `C++`. Most packages built with `vs2015` can be linked with
`vs2017` toolchain (but not vice-versa). An exception is static
libraries compiled with whole program optimization (/GL flag) which may
be incompatible with the `vs2017` toolchain. These static libraries will
need to be rebuilt using `vs2017`.
