# Completed New Staging Process for `anaconda.org` Uploads

We have now completed rolling out the new staging process for uploads to
anaconda.org. Direct uploads to the `conda-forge` channel will no longer
work. If you are having trouble with package uploads, please rerender
your feedstock with the latest version of `conda-smithy`. As always, if
you need help, bump us on Gitter or GitHub!
