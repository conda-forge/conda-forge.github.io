# Dropping python 3.9 support in conda-forge

With python 3.9 reaching end-of-life in Oct 2025 and python
3.14 being released the same month, we have decided to drop
support for building new packages with 3.9 support now.
The decision to drop support 1.5 months before the EOL is
to avoid the strain on conda-forge CI while we add new
3.14 support in conda-forge.
