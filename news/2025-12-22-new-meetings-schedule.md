# New community meetings schedule for 2026

Starting in 2026, the conda-forge core calls will merge with the [conda community calls](https://conda.org/community/calendar) in a single timeslot. Instead of alternating weeks, from now on, both communities will share the same space every Wednesday. There are two rotating timeslots:

- 2PM UTC
- 5PM UTC

The first meeting in 2026 will take place on January 7th, at 5PM UTC. For more details consult [our calendar](/community/meetings/).

The meeting minutes will be available in both conda.org and conda-forge.org, in the usual places.

This is one of our first steps towards reducing the administrative duplication existing between these overlapping communities.
