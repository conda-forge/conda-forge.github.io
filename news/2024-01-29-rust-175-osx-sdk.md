# Rust 1.75 requires setting newer MACOSX_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET

With the release of `rust 1.75`, we now require setting the minimal
`MACOSX_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET` to at least `10.12`. You can do this by appending
`recipe/conda_build_config.yaml` with the following content:

```yaml
c_stdlib_version:       # [osx and x86]
  - '10.12'             # [osx and x86]
```

and adding `{{ stdlib("c") }}` as build dependency next to your compiler jinja:

```yaml
  build:
    - {{ compiler("rust") }}
    - {{ stdlib("c") }}
```

Note: This entry was update in April 2024 to reflect the new infrastructure for
setting `MACOSX_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET`, see
[here](https://conda-forge.org/news/2024/03/24/stdlib-migration/).
