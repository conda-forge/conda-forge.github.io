Using CMake
===========

`CMake <https://cmake.org/>`__ can be used to build more complex projects in ``build.sh``
or ``bld.bat`` scripts.

If you are using cmake, be sure to make it a build requirement in the ``build`` section. You
may also need to include ``make`` or ``ninja`` depending on your platform and build tools.
On Windows, you can also use ``nmake`` to build, but that does not need to be explicitly included.

.. code-block:: yaml

    requirements:
      build:
        - cmake
        - make  # [not win]
        - ninja  # [win]

For CMake projects using the `FindPython3 <https://cmake.org/cmake/help/git-stage/module/FindPython3.html>`__
module, you can tell CMake which Python to use by passing ``-DPython3_EXECUTABLE="$PYTHON"``
(macOS or Linux) or ``-DPython3_EXECUTABLE="%PYTHON%"`` (Windows) as a command line option.
Older CMake projects may require similar, but slightly different options.

Some optional, but useful CMake options:

    - ``-DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release`` Configure as release build. This is better done on the initial
      ``cmake`` call as some packages construct different build configurations depending on this flag.
    - ``-DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=$PREFIX`` Specify the install location.
    - ``-DCMAKE_INSTALL_LIBDIR=lib`` Libraries will land in $PREFIX/lib, sometimes projects install
      into lib64 or similar but on conda-forge we keep shared libraries in simply lib.
    - ``-DBUILD_SHARED_LIBS=ON`` Instruct CMake to build shared libraries instead of static ones.

Here are some basic commands to get you started. These are dependent on your source
code layout and aren't intended to be used "as is".

**CMake lines for build.sh (macOS/Linux):**

.. code-block::

    cmake CMakeLists.txt -DPython3_EXECUTABLE="$PYTHON"
    cmake --build . --config Release

**CMake lines for bld.bat (Windows):**

.. code-block::

    cmake -G "NMake Makefiles" -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -DPython3_EXECUTABLE="%PYTHON%"
    if errorlevel 1 exit /b 1
    cmake --build . --config Release
    if errorlevel 1 exit /b 1

See also the ``bld.bat`` in the Windows section below for an additional example.

Other useful ``cmake`` options are ``-B<directory>`` and ``-S<directory>`` to specify build and source
directories.

Moving from an autotools build to a CMake build
-----------------------------------------------

Some packages maintain an autotools build and a cmake build. Some maintainers
would like to switch to a cmake build because that provides windows builds
easily. These builds are mostly not ABI compatible with each other.
Here are some things you should check,

1. Check that both libraries have the same SONAME on linux

   Run ``readelf -d /path/to/lib.so``

2. Check that both libraries have the same install name and have the same
   compatibility and current versions.

   Run ``otool -L /path/to/lib.dylib``. The second line should give you
   the three pieces of information

3. Check that the file list is the same in both.

4. Check that you use the same options as the same autoconf build.

5. Check that the symbols exported are the same.

6. Check that additional packaging information stays the same, e.g. is the same pkg-config information provided.


Particularities on Windows
==========================

This document presents conda-forge and conda-build information and examples
when building on Windows.


Local testing
-------------

The first thing that you should know is that you can locally test Windows
builds of your packages even if you don’t own a Windows machine. Microsoft
makes available free, official Windows virtual machines (VMs) `at this website
<https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-edge/tools/vms/>`_. If you
are unfamiliar with VM systems or have trouble installing Microsoft’s, please
use a general web search to investigate — while these topics are beyond the
scope of this documentation, there is ample discussion of them on the broader
Internet.

In order to compile native code (C, C++, etc.) on Windows, you will need to
install Microsoft’s Visual C++ build tools on your VM. You must install
particular versions of these tools — this is to maintain compatibility between
compiled libraries used in Python, `as described on this Python wiki page
<https://wiki.python.org/moin/WindowsCompilers>`_. The current relevant
versions are:

* For Python 2.7: Visual C++ 9.0
* For Python 3.5–3.7: Visual C++ 14.0

While you can obtain these tools by installing the right version of the full
`Visual Studio <https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/>`_ development
environment, you can save a lot of time and bandwidth by installing standalone
“build tools” packages. The links are:

* For Python 2.7: `Microsoft Visual C++ Compiler for Python 2.7
  <https://www.microsoft.com/download/details.aspx?id=44266>`_.
* For Python 3.5–3.7: `Microsoft Build Tools for Visual Studio 2017
  <https://www.visualstudio.com/downloads/#build-tools-for-visual-studio-2017>`_.

Please see `the Python wiki page on Windows compilers
<https://wiki.python.org/moin/WindowsCompilers>`_ if you need more
information.


Simple CMake-Based ``bld.bat``
------------------------------
Some projects provide hooks for CMake to build the project. The following
example ``bld.bat`` file demonstrates how to build a traditional, out-of-core
build for such projects.

**CMake-based bld.bat:**

.. code-block:: bat

    setlocal EnableDelayedExpansion

    :: Make a build folder and change to it.
    mkdir build
    cd build

    :: Configure using the CMakeFiles
    cmake -G "NMake Makefiles" ^
          -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX:PATH="%LIBRARY_PREFIX%" ^
          -DCMAKE_PREFIX_PATH:PATH="%LIBRARY_PREFIX%" ^
          -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE:STRING=Release ^
          ..
    if errorlevel 1 exit 1

    :: Build!
    nmake
    if errorlevel 1 exit 1

    :: Install!
    nmake install
    if errorlevel 1 exit 1

The following feedstocks are examples of this build structure deployed:

* `libpng <https://github.com/conda-forge/libpng-feedstock/blob/master/recipe/bld.bat>`_
* `pugixml <https://github.com/conda-forge/pugixml-feedstock/blob/master/recipe/bld.bat>`_


Building for different VC versions
----------------------------------

On Windows, different Visual C versions have different ABI and therefore a package needs to be built for different
Visual C versions. Packages are tied to the VC version that they were built with and some packages have specific
requirements of the VC version. For example, python 2.7 requires ``vc 9`` and python 3.5 requires ``vc 14``.

With ``conda-build 3.x``, ``vc`` can be used as a selector when using the ``compiler`` jinja syntax.

.. code-block:: yaml

    requirements:
      build:
        - {{ compiler('cxx') }}

To skip building with a particular ``vc`` version, add a skip statement.

.. code-block:: yaml

    build:
        skip: true  # [win and vc<14]

    requirements:
      build:
        - {{ compiler('cxx') }}



Special dependencies
====================

.. _dep_compilers:

Compilers
---------

Compilers are dependencies with a special syntax and are always added to ``requirements/build``.

There are currently three supported compilers:

 - c
 - cxx
 - fortran

A package that needs all three compilers would define

.. code-block:: yaml

    requirements:
      build:
        - {{ compiler('c') }}
        - {{ compiler('cxx') }}
        - {{ compiler('fortran') }}

.. note::

  Appropriate compiler runtime packages will be automatically added to the package's runtime requirements and therefore
  there's no need to specify ``libgcc`` or ``libgfortran``. There is additional information about how conda-build 3 treats
  compilers in the `conda docs <https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda-build/en/latest/source/compiler-tools.html>`_.

.. _cdt_packages:

Core Dependency Tree Packages (CDTs)
------------------------------------

Dependencies outside of the ``conda-forge`` channel should be avoided (see :ref:`no_external_deps`).
However, there are a few exceptions: some dependencies are so close to the system
that they are not packaged with ``conda-forge``. These dependencies have to be satisfied with
*Core Dependency Tree* (CDT) packages. A CDT package consists of repackaged CentOS binaries from the
appropriate version, either 6 or 7 depending on user choice and platform. We manage the build of CDT
packages using a centralized repo, `conda-forge/cdt-builds <https://github.com/conda-forge/cdt-builds>`_,
as opposed to generating feedstocks for them. (Note that historically we did use feedstocks but this
practice has been deprecated.) To add a new CDT, make a PR on the
`conda-forge/cdt-builds <https://github.com/conda-forge/cdt-builds>`_ repo.

In ``conda-forge`` the primary usages of CDTs is currently for packages that link against libGL.

libGL
^^^^^

In addition to the required compilers ``{{ compiler('c') }}`` and/or ``{{ compiler('cxx') }}``,
the following CDT packages are required for linking against libGL:

.. code-block:: yaml

  requirements:
    build:
      - {{ cdt('mesa-libgl-devel') }}  # [linux]
      - {{ cdt('mesa-dri-drivers') }}  # [linux]
      - {{ cdt('libselinux') }}  # [linux]
      - {{ cdt('libxdamage') }}  # [linux]
      - {{ cdt('libxxf86vm') }}  # [linux]
      - {{ cdt('libxext') }}     # [linux]
    host:
      - xorg-libxfixes  # [linux]


If you need a fully functional binary in the test phase, you have to also provide the shared
libraries via ``yum_requirements.txt`` (see :ref:`yum_deps`).

.. code-block:: text

  mesa-libGL
  mesa-dri-drivers
  libselinux
  libXdamage
  libXxf86vm
  libXext

You will need to re-render the feedstock after making these changes.

.. _linking_numpy:

Building Against NumPy
----------------------

Packages that link against NumPy need special treatment in the dependency section.
Finding ``numpy.get_include()`` in ``setup.py`` or ``cimport`` statements in ``.pyx`` or ``.pyd`` files are a telltale sign that the package links against NumPy.

In the case of linking, you need to use the ``pin_compatible`` function to ensure having a compatible numpy version at run time:

.. code-block:: yaml

    host:
      - numpy
    run:
      - {{ pin_compatible('numpy') }}


At the time of writing, above is equivalent to the following,

.. code-block:: yaml

    host:
      - numpy 1.14.6
    run:
      - numpy >=1.14.6,<2.0.a0


.. admonition:: Notes

    1. You still need to respect minimum supported version of ``numpy`` for the package!
    That means you cannot use ``numpy 1.9`` if the project requires at least ``numpy 1.12``,
    adjust the minimum version accordingly!

    .. code-block:: yaml

        host:
          - numpy 1.12.*
        run:
          - {{ pin_compatible('numpy') }}


    2. if your package supports ``numpy 1.7``, and you are brave enough :-),
    there are ``numpy`` packages for ``1.7`` available for Python 2.7 in the channel.


Message passing interface (MPI)
-------------------------------

.. note::

  This section originates from Min's notes: https://hackmd.io/ry4uI0thTs2q_b4mAQd_qg

MPI Variants in conda-forge
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

How are MPI variants best handled in conda-forge?


There are a few broad cases:

- package requires a specific MPI provider (easy!)
- the package works with any MPI provider (e.g. mpich, openmpi)
- the package works with/without MPI

Note that sometimes users want to use packages in ``conda-forge`` built against
our MPI libraries but linked to external MPI libraries at runtime. If you are interested
in this procedure, see :ref:`Using External Message Passing Interface (MPI) Libraries`
for details.

Building MPI variants
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

In `conda_build_config.yaml`:

.. code-block:: yaml

  mpi:
    - mpich
    - openmpi


In `meta.yaml`:

.. code-block:: yaml

  requirements:
    host:
      - {{ mpi }}

And rerender with:

.. code-block:: bash

  conda-smithy rerender -c auto

to produce the build matrices.

Current builds of both mpi providers have `run_exports` which is equivalent to adding:

.. code-block:: yaml

  requirements:
    run:
      - {{ pin_run_as_build(mpi, min_pin='x.x', max_pin='x.x') }}

If you want to do the pinning yourself (i.e. not trust the mpi providers, or pin differently, add):

.. code-block:: yaml

  # conda_build_config.yaml
  pin_run_as_build:
    mpich: x.x
    openmpi: x.x

.. code-block:: yaml

  # meta.yaml
  requirements:
    host:
      - {{ mpi }}
    run:
      - {{ mpi }}

Including a no-mpi build
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Some packages (e.g. hdf5) may want a no-mpi build, in addition to the mpi builds.
To do this, add `nompi` to the mpi matrix:

.. code-block:: yaml

  mpi:
    - nompi
    - mpich
    - openmpi

and apply the appropriate conditionals in your build:

.. code-block:: yaml

  requirements:
    host:
      - {{ mpi }}  # [mpi != 'nompi']
    run:
      - {{ mpi }}  # [mpi != 'nompi']



Preferring a provider (usually nompi)
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

Up to here, mpi providers have no explicit preference. When choosing an MPI provider, the mutual exclusivity of
the ``mpi`` metapackage allows picking between mpi providers by installing an mpi provider, e.g.

.. code-block:: bash

    conda install mpich ptscotch

or

.. code-block:: bash

    conda install openmpi ptscotch

This doesn't extend to ``nompi``, because there is no ``nompi`` variant of the mpi metapackage. And there probably
shouldn't be, because some packages built with mpi doesn't preclude other packages in the env that *may* have an mpi variant
from using the no-mpi variant of the library (e.g. for a long time, fenics used mpi with no-mpi hdf5 since there was no
parallel hdf5 yet. This works fine, though some features may not be available).

Typically, if there is a preference it will be packaged with a nompi variant, where the serial build is
preferred, such that installers/requirers of the package only get the mpi build if explicitly requested.


.. admonition:: Outdated

  To de-prioritize a build in the solver, it can be given a special ``track_features`` field:

  - All builds *other than* the priority build should have a ``track_features`` field
  - Build strings can be used to allow downstream packages to make explicit dependencies.
  - No package should actually *have* the tracked feature.


  .. note::

    **update**: track_features deprioritization has too high priority in the solver, preventing a package from
    adopting a variant of a dependency after some builds have already been made. Instead, use a build number
    offset to apply the preference at a more appropriate level.


Here is an example build section:

::

  {% if mpi == 'nompi' %}
  # prioritize nompi variant via build number
  {% set build = build + 100 %}
  {% endif %}
  build:
    number: {{ build }}

    # add build string so packages can depend on
    # mpi or nompi variants explicitly:
    # `pkg * mpi_mpich_*` for mpich
    # `pkg * mpi_*` for any mpi
    # `pkg * nompi_*` for no mpi

    {% set mpi_prefix = "mpi_" + mpi %}
    {% else %}
    {% set mpi_prefix = "nompi" %}
    {% endif %}
    string: "{{ mpi_prefix }}_h{{ PKG_HASH }}_{{ build }}"

.. note::

  ``{{ PKG_HASH }}`` avoids build string collisions on *most* variants,
  but not on packages that are excluded from the default build string,
  e.g. Python itself. If the package is built for multiple Python versions, use:

  .. code-block:: yaml

    string: "{{ mpi_prefix }}_py{{ py }}h{{ PKG_HASH }}_{{ build }}"

  as seen in `mpi4py <https://github.com/conda-forge/h5py-feedstock/pull/49/commits/b08ee9307d16864e775f1a7f9dd10f25c83b5974>`__


This build section creates the following packages:

- ``pkg-x.y.z-mpi_mpich_h12345_0``
- ``pkg-x.y.z-mpi_openmpi_h23456_0``
- ``pkg-x.y.z-nompi_h34567_100``

Which has the following consequences:

- The ``nompi`` variant is preferred, and will be installed by default unless an mpi variant is explicitly requested.
- mpi variants can be explicitly requested with ``pkg=*=mpi_{{ mpi }}_*``
- any mpi variant, ignoring provider, can be requested with ``pkg=*=mpi_*``
- nompi variant can be explicitly requested with ``pkg=*=nompi_*``

If building with this library creates a runtime dependency on the variant, the build string pinning can be added to ``run_exports``.

For example, if building against the nompi variant will work with any installed version, but building with a
given mpi provider requires running with that mpi:


::

  build:
    ...
    {% if mpi != 'nompi' %}
    run_exports:
      - {{ name }} * {{ mpi_prefix }}_*
    {% endif %}

Remove the ``if mpi...`` condition if all variants should create a strict runtime dependency based on the variant
chosen at build time (i.e. if the nompi build cannot be run against the mpich build).

Complete example
""""""""""""""""

Combining all of the above, here is a complete recipe, with:

- nompi, mpich, openmpi variants
- run-exports to apply mpi choice made at build time to runtime where nompi builds can be run with mpi, but not vice versa.
- nompi variant is preferred by default
- only build nompi on Windows

This matches what is done in `hdf5 <https://github.com/conda-forge/hdf5-feedstock/pull/90>`__.


.. code-block:: yaml

  # conda_build_config.yaml
  mpi:
    - nompi
    - mpich  # [not win]
    - openmpi  # [not win]

::

  # meta.yaml
  {% set name = 'pkg' %}
  {% set build = 1000 %}

  # ensure mpi is defined (needed for conda-smithy recipe-lint)
  {% set mpi = mpi or 'nompi' %}

  {% if mpi == 'nompi' %}
  # prioritize nompi variant via build number
  {% set build = build + 100 %}
  {% endif %}

  build:
    number: {{ build }}

    # add build string so packages can depend on
    # mpi or nompi variants explicitly:
    # `pkg * mpi_mpich_*` for mpich
    # `pkg * mpi_*` for any mpi
    # `pkg * nompi_*` for no mpi

    {% if mpi != 'nompi' %}
    {% set mpi_prefix = "mpi_" + mpi %}
    {% else %}
    {% set mpi_prefix = "nompi" %}
    {% endif %}
    string: "{{ mpi_prefix }}_h{{ PKG_HASH }}_{{ build }}"

    {% if mpi != 'nompi' %}
    run_exports:
      - {{ name }} * {{ mpi_prefix }}_*
    {% endif %}

  requirements:
    host:
      - {{ mpi }}  # [mpi != 'nompi']
    run:
      - {{ mpi }}  # [mpi != 'nompi']

And then a package that depends on this one can explicitly pick the appropriate mpi builds:

.. code-block:: yaml

  # meta.yaml

  requirements:
    host:
      - {{ mpi }}  # [mpi != 'nompi']
      - pkg
      - pkg * mpi_{{ mpi }}_*  # [mpi != 'nompi']
    run:
      - {{ mpi }}  # [mpi != 'nompi']
      - pkg * mpi_{{ mpi }}_*  # [mpi != 'nompi']

mpi-metapackage exclusivity allows ``mpi_*`` to resolve the same as ``mpi_{{ mpi }}_*``
if ``{{ mpi }}`` is also a direct dependency, though it's probably nicer to be explicit.

Just mpi example
""""""""""""""""

Without a preferred ``nompi`` variant, recipes that require mpi are much simpler. This is all that is needed:

.. code-block:: yaml

  # conda_build_config.yaml
  mpi:
    - mpich
    - openmpi

.. code-block:: yaml

  # meta.yaml
  requirements:
    host:
      - {{ mpi }}
    run:
      - {{ mpi }}



OpenMP
------

You can enable OpenMP on macOS by adding the ``llvm-openmp`` package to the ``build`` section of the ``meta.yaml``.
For Linux OpenMP support is on by default, however it's better to explicitly depend on the `libgomp` package which is the OpenMP
implementation from the GNU project.

 .. code-block:: yaml

  # meta.yaml
  requirements:
    build:
      - llvm-openmp  # [osx]
      - libgomp      # [linux]

Switching OpenMP implementation
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

On macOS, only LLVM's OpenMP implementation ``llvm-openmp`` is supported. This implementation is used even in Fortran code compiled
using GNU's gfortran.

On Linux (except aarch64), packages are linked against GNU's ``libgomp.so.1``, but the OpenMP library at install time can be
switched from GNU to LLVM by doing the following.

 .. code-block:: shell

    conda install _openmp_mutex=*=*_llvm

OpenMP library can be switched back to GNU's libgomp by doing the following.

 .. code-block:: shell

    conda install _openmp_mutex=*=*_gnu

.. note::

  OpenMP library switching is possible because LLVM's implementation has the symbol's from GNU in addition to the LLVM
  ones (originally from Intel). An object file generated by ``gcc``, ``g++`` or ``gfortran`` will have GNU's symbols and
  therefore the underlying library can be switched.
  However, an object file generated by ``clang`` or ``clang++`` will have LLVM's symbols and therefore the underlying
  OpenMP library cannot be switched to GNU's library.

  One reason you may wish to switch to LLVM is because the implementation is fork safe. One reason to keep using the
  GNU implementation is that the OpenMP target offloading symbols in ``libgomp`` like ``GOMP_target`` are empty stubs
  in LLVM and therefore does not work.


.. _yum_deps:

yum_requirements.txt
--------------------

Dependencies can be installed into the build container with ``yum``, by listing package names line by line in a file
named ``yum_requirements.txt`` in the ``recipe`` directory of a feedstock.

There are only very few situations where dependencies installed by yum are acceptable. These cases include

  - satisfying the requirements of :term:`CDT` packages during test phase
  - installing packages that are only required for testing

After changing ``yum_requirements.txt``, :ref:`rerender <dev_update_rerender>` to update the configuration.


Special packages
================

.. _knowledge:blas:

BLAS
----

If a package needs one of BLAS, CBLAS, LAPACK, LAPACKE, use the following in the
host of the recipe,

.. code-block:: yaml

    requirements:
      host:
        - libblas
        - libcblas
        - liblapack
        - liblapacke

.. note::
  You should specify only the libraries that the package needs. (i.e. if the package
  doesn't need LAPACK, remove liblapack and liblapacke)

  At recipe build time, above requirements would download the NETLIB's reference
  implementations and build your recipe against those.
  At runtime, by default the following packages will be used.

.. code-block:: yaml

    - openblas   # [not win]
    - mkl        # [win]

If a package needs a specific implementation's internal API for more control you can have,

.. code-block:: yaml

    requirements:
      host:
        - {{ blas_impl }}
      run:
        - libblas * *{{ blas_impl }}
        - {{ blas_impl }}

This would give you a matrix builds for different blas implementations. If you only want to support
a specific blas implementation,

.. code-block:: yaml

    requirements:
      host:
        - openblas
      run:
        - libblas * *openblas
        - openblas

.. note::
  ``blas_*`` features should not be used anymore.

Switching BLAS implementation
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

You can switch your BLAS implementation by doing,

.. code-block:: bash

    conda install "libblas=*=*mkl"
    conda install "libblas=*=*openblas"
    conda install "libblas=*=*blis"
    conda install "libblas=*=*netlib"

This would change the BLAS implementation without changing the conda packages depending
on BLAS.

The following legacy commands are also supported as well.

.. code-block:: bash

    conda install "blas=*=mkl"
    conda install "blas=*=openblas"
    conda install "blas=*=blis"
    conda install "blas=*=netlib"

.. note::

  If you want to commit to a specific blas implementation, you can prevent conda from switching back by pinning
  the blas implementation in your environment. To commit to mkl, add ``blas=*=mkl`` to
  ``<conda-root>/envs/<env-name>/conda-meta/pinned``, as described in the
  `conda-docs <https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/tasks/manage-pkgs.html#preventing-packages-from-updating-pinning>`__.

How it works
^^^^^^^^^^^^

At recipe build time, the netlib packages are used. This means that the downstream package will
link to ``libblas.so.3`` in the ``libblas=*=*netlib`` and will use only the reference
implementation's symbols.

``libblas`` and ``libcblas`` versioning is based on the Reference LAPACK versioning which at the
time of writing is ``3.8.0``. Since the BLAS API is stable, a downstream package will only pin to
``3.*`` of ``libblas`` and ``libcblas``. On the other hand, ``liblapack`` and ``liblapacke`` pins to
``3.8.*``.

In addition to the above netlib package, there are other variants like ``libblas=*=*openblas``,
which has ``openblas`` as a dependency and has a symlink from ``libblas.so.3`` to ``libopenblas.so``.
``libblas=3.8.0=*openblas`` pins the ``openblas`` dependency to a version that is known to support the
BLAS ``3.8.0`` API.  This means that, at install time, the user can select what BLAS implementation
they like without any knowledge of the version of the BLAS implementation needed.


.. _knowledge:mpl:

Matplotlib
----------

``matplotlib`` on ``conda-forge`` comes in two parts. The core library is in ``matplotlib-base``. The
actual ``matplotlib`` package is this core library plus ``pyqt``. Most, if not all, packages that have
dependence at runtime on ``matplotlib`` should list this dependence as ``matplotlib-base`` unless they
explicitly need ``pyqt``. The idea is that a user installing ``matplotlib`` explicitly would get a full
featured installation with ``pyqt``. However, ``pyqt`` is a rather large package, so not requiring it
indirectly is better for performance. Note that you may need to include a ``yum_requirements.txt`` file
in your recipe with

.. code-block:: bash

    xorg-x11-server-Xorg

if you import parts of ``matplotlib`` that link to ``libX11``.

Noarch builds
=============

Noarch packages are packages that are not architecture specific and therefore only have to be built once.

Declaring these packages as ``noarch`` in the ``build`` section of the meta.yaml, reduces shared CI resources.
Therefore all packages that qualify to be noarch packages, should be declared as such.


.. _noarch:

Noarch python
-------------
The ``noarch: python`` directive, in the ``build`` section, makes pure-Python
packages that only need to be built once.

In order to qualify as a noarch python package, all of the following criteria must be fulfilled:

  - No compiled extensions
  - No post-link or pre-link or pre-unlink scripts
  - No OS-specific build scripts
  - No python version specific requirements
  - No skips except for python version. If the recipe is py3 only, remove skip
    statement and add version constraint on python in ``host`` and ``run``
    section.
  - ``2to3`` is not used
  - Scripts argument in setup.py is not used
  - If ``console_script`` ``entry_points`` are defined in ``setup.py`` or ``setup.cfg``, they are also listed in
    the ``build`` section of ``meta.yaml``
  - No activate scripts
  - Not a dependency of conda

.. note::

  While ``noarch: python`` does not work with selectors, it does work with version constraints.
  ``skip: True  # [py2k]`` can be replaced with a constrained python version in the host and run subsections:
  say ``python >=3`` instead of just ``python``.

.. note::

  Only ``console_script`` entry points have to be listed in meta.yaml. Other entry points do not conflict
  with ``noarch`` and therefore do not require extra treatment.

If an existing python package qualifies to be converted to a noarch package, you can request the required changes
by opening a new issue and including ``@conda-forge-admin, please add noarch: python``.


Noarch generic
--------------

.. todo::

  add some information on r packages which make heavy use of ``noarch: generic``


Build matrices
==============

Currently, ``python, vc, r-base`` will create a matrix of jobs for each supported version. If ``python`` is only a
build dependency and not a runtime dependency (eg: build script of the package is written in Python, but the
package is not dependent on python), use ``build`` section

Following implies that ``python`` is only a build dependency and no Python matrix will be created.

.. code-block:: yaml

    build:
      - python
    host:
      - some_other_package


Note that ``host`` should be non-empty or ``compiler`` jinja syntax used or ``build/merge_build_host`` set to
True for the ``build`` section to be treated as different from ``host``.

Following implies that ``python`` is a runtime dependency and a Python matrix for each supported python version will be created.

.. code-block:: yaml

    host:
      - python

``conda-forge.yml``'s build matrices is removed in conda-smithy=3. To get a build matrix,
create a ``conda_build_config.yaml`` file inside the recipe folder. For example, the following will give you 2
builds and you can use the selector ``vtk_with_osmesa`` in the ``meta.yaml``

.. code-block:: yaml

    vtk_with_osmesa:
      - False
      - True

You need to rerender the feedstock after this change.

Requiring newer macOS SDKs
==========================

conda-forge uses macOS SDK 10.9 to build software so that they can be deployed to
all macOS versions newer than 10.9. Sometimes, some packages require a newer SDK
to build with. While the default version 10.9 can be overridden using the following
changes to the recipe, it should be done as a last resort. Please consult with
core team if this is something you think you need.

To use a new SDK, add the following in ``recipe/conda_build_config.yaml``

.. code-block:: yaml

    MACOSX_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET:  # [osx]
      - 10.12                  # [osx]

In ``recipe/meta.yaml``, add the following to ensure that the user's system is compatible.

.. code-block:: yaml

    requirements:
      run_constrained:
        - __osx >={{ MACOSX_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET|default("10.9") }}  # [osx]

Note that the requirement is a `run_constrained`, because the ``__osx`` virtual package
is supported only by ``conda>=4.8``. Once that conda version is used widely, the
requirement will be changed from ``run_constrained`` to ``run``.

PyPy builds
===========

To use the PyPy builds you can do the following,

.. code-block:: bash

   conda install python=3.6.*=*_pypy

or,

.. code-block:: bash

   conda install pypy python=3.6

or,

.. code-block:: bash

   conda install pypy

.. note::

   As of March 8, if you are using defaults as a low priority channel,
   then you need to use strict channel priority as the metadata in defaults
   has not been patched yet which allows cpython extension packages to be
   installed alongside pypy.

.. code-block:: bash

   conda config --set channel_priority strict

To build your python package for pypy, wait for the bot to send a
PR and contact ``conda-forge/bot`` team if a PR is not sent after the
dependencies have been built.

To add a dependency just for pypy or cpython, do,

.. code-block:: yaml

   requirements:
     run:
       - spam           # [python_impl == 'cpython']
       - ham            # [python_impl == 'pypy']

.. note::

   You'll need to rerender the feedstocks after making the above
   change in order for the ``python_impl`` variable to be available to
   conda-build

To skip the pypy builds, do the following,

.. code-block:: yaml

   build:
     skip: True         # [python_impl == 'pypy']
