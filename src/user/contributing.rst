Becoming involved
*****************

conda-forge is a community-driven effort of cross-platform packaging and as such relies on volunteers to sustain and improve.

Help is always welcome! You can contribute e.g. by

 - contributing new packages (:ref:`dev_contribute_pkgs`)
 - help updating and maintaining packages (:ref:`maintaining_pkgs`)
 - suggesting and implementing improvements for our :ref:`infrastructure`
 - help :ref:`improve_docs`


.. _improve_docs:

Improving the documentation
===========================

You can help improve this documentation! It is version-controlled in the
`conda-forge.github.io repository
<https://github.com/conda-forge/conda-forge.github.io>`_ on GitHub. The source
text is stored there in `the src/ subdirectory
<https://github.com/conda-forge/conda-forge.github.io/tree/master/src>`_ and
is formatted using Python’s `reStructuredText
<http://docutils.sourceforge.net/rst.html>`_ system.

You can propose quick edits directly through the GitHub website, if you have
an account there — for instance, `this link
<https://github.com/conda-forge/conda-forge.github.io/edit/master/src/user/contributing.rst>`_
will take you directly to a web-based editor for this very webpage. In
general, the file corresponding to each page in the GitHub browser has a
little pencil icon in its top-right that lets you open it up for editing.

The more manual process is as follows:

1. `Fork <https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/>`_ the
   `conda-forge.github.io repository
   <https://github.com/conda-forge/conda-forge.github.io>`_ to your own GitHub
   user account.
2. `Clone <https://help.github.com/articles/cloning-a-repository/>`_ that fork
   onto your computer.
3. `Check out
   <https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Branching-Basic-Branching-and-Merging>`_
   a new branch deriving from ``master`` to do your work.
4. Make and `commit
   <https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Basics-Recording-Changes-to-the-Repository>`_
   your changes.
5. Submit a `pull request
   <https://help.github.com/articles/about-pull-requests/>`_ to the main
   repository proposing your changes.

Happy editing!
