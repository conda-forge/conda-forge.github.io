Improve the documentation
===========================

The ``conda-forge`` documentation is version-controlled in the
`conda-forge.github.io repository
<https://github.com/conda-forge/conda-forge.github.io>`_ on GitHub. The source
text is stored in `the src/ subdirectory
<https://github.com/conda-forge/conda-forge.github.io/tree/master/src>`_ of this repository and
is formatted using Python’s `reStructuredText
<http://docutils.sourceforge.net/rst.html>`_ system.

You can propose quick edits directly through the GitHub website if you have
a GitHub account — for instance, `this link
<https://github.com/conda-forge/conda-forge.github.io/edit/master/src/user/contributing.rst>`_
will take you directly to a web-based editor for this very webpage. In
general, the file corresponding to each page in the GitHub browser has a
little pencil icon in its top-right corner that lets you open it up for editing.

We are glad to know that you would like to contribute to the ``conda-forge`` documentation. If you are new to the conda-forge community, follow the steps below to make your first contribution:

1. `Fork <https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/>`_ the
   `conda-forge.github.io repository
   <https://github.com/conda-forge/conda-forge.github.io>`_.
2. `Clone <https://help.github.com/articles/cloning-a-repository/>`_ this fork onto your computer.
3. `Check out
   <https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Branching-Basic-Branching-and-Merging>`_
   a new branch deriving from ``master`` to do your work.
4. Make and `commit
   <https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Basics-Recording-Changes-to-the-Repository>`_
   your changes.
5. Submit a `pull request
   <https://help.github.com/articles/about-pull-requests/>`_ to the main repository proposing your changes.
