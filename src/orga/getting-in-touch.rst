Getting in Touch
================

The community at conda-forge would be happy to connect with you. We have got several ways for you to communicate with us, primarily through issue trackers, mailing lists, and real-time chat.

Issue Trackers
---------------

The main issue trackers that you will interact with are: 

* `staged-recipes <https://github.com/conda-forge/staged-recipes/issues>`__: You can use staged-recipes repository to create a new conda package on conda-forge.
* `conda-forge.github.io repository <https://github.com/conda-forge/conda-forge.github.io/issues>`__: You can use this repository to raise policy issues and as a catch-all for other issues where youâ€™re unsure where to put them.
* If you want to file an issue about an individual package, go to that pacakge's feedstock repository. So, say if you want to raise an issue for the package ``unzip``, go to its feedstock repository `here <https://github.com/conda-forge/unzip-feedstock/issues>`__. You can search for the package you wish to open an issue for `here <https://github.com/conda-forge/feedstocks/tree/main/feedstocks>`_
* `Our enhancement proposals repository <https://github.com/conda-forge/cfep/issues>`__: You can use the enhancement proposals repository if you're interested in substantially changing the way conda-forge operates.
*  Issues related to Anaconda, Conda, or related tools can be reported `here <https://anaconda.org/contact/report>`_.

Gitter
-----------------

The main chat rooms that you'll interact with are

* `gitter: general <https://gitter.im/conda-forge/conda-forge.github.io>`__: Our general chat room for all things conda-forge. Pretty much any question can be asked here and others in the community may be able to help.
  Move stuff to an issue tracker if your question isn't getting resolved.
* `gitter: core/private <https://gitter.im/conda-forge/core>`__: Private chat for the @conda-forge/core team to discuss continued operations and improvements to conda-forge.
* `gitter: power pc <https://gitter.im/conda-forge-ppc64le/Lobby>`__: Public chat room for all things related to building for power pc (IBM) systems.
* `gitter: bot subteam <https://gitter.im/conda-forge/regro-cf-autotick-bot>`__: Public chat room for all things related to the conda-forge automation infrastructure.
  Our automation infrastructure is colloquially referred to as "the bot".
* `gitter: compilers <https://gitter.im/conda-forge/conda-forge-compilers>`__: Public chat room focused on the conda-forge compiler stack.

Mailing List
-----------------

* `google group: conda-forge <https://groups.google.com/g/conda-forge>`__: The general mailing list for conda-forge.
  Sees a moderate amount of traffic, though substantially lower than the public gitter room.

Other Communication Methods
-----------------------------

* The core team is also on Keybase for security related stuff. If you're part of the core team and don't have
  access, ping someone on the core team for access.
