Getting in Touch
================

There are many ways to get in touch with the conda-forge community, primarily
through issue trackers, mailing lists, and real-time chat.

The main issue trackers that you will interact with are

* `staged-recipes <https://github.com/conda-forge/staged-recipes/issues>`_: You'll use staged-recipes to create a new conda package on conda-forge
* `our main docs repo <https://github.com/conda-forge/conda-forge.github.io/issues>`_: You'll use this repo as a catch-all for issues where you're not sure where else to put them
* `our enhancement proposals repo <https://github.com/conda-forge/cfep/issues>`_: You'll use the enhancement proposals repo if you're interested in substantially changing the way conda-forge operates.

The main chat rooms that you'll interact with are

* `gitter: general <https://gitter.im/conda-forge/conda-forge.github.io>`_: Our general chat room for all things conda-forge. Pretty much any question can be asked here and others in the community may be able to help.
  Move stuff to an issue tracker if your question isn't getting resolved.
* `gitter: core/private <https://gitter.im/conda-forge/core>`_: Private chat for the @conda-forge/core team to discuss continued operations and improvements to conda-forge.
* `gitter: power pc <https://gitter.im/conda-forge-ppc64le/Lobby>`_: Public chat room for all things related to building for power pc (IBM) systems.
* `gitter: bot subteam <https://gitter.im/conda-forge/regro-cf-autotick-bot>`_: Public chat room for all things related to the conda-forge automation infrastructure.
  Our automation infrastructure is colloquially referred to as "the bot".
* `gitter: compilers <https://gitter.im/conda-forge/conda-forge-compilers>`_: Public chat room focused on the conda-forge compiler stack.

Mailing lists

* `google group: conda-forge <https://groups.google.com/g/conda-forge>`_: The general mailing list for conda-forge.
  Sees a moderate amount of traffic, though substantially lower than the public gitter room.

Other communication methods

* The core team is also on Keybase for security related stuff. If you're part of the core team and don't have
  access, ping someone on the core team for access.
