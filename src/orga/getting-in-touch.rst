Getting in Touch
================

The community at conda-forge would be happy to connect with you. We have got several ways for you to communicate with us, primarily through issue trackers, mailing lists, and real-time chat.

Issue Trackers
-----------------

The main issue trackers that you will interact with are

* `staged-recipes <https://github.com/conda-forge/staged-recipes/issues>`__: You'll use staged-recipes to create a new conda package on conda-forge
* `Our main docs repo <https://github.com/conda-forge/conda-forge.github.io/issues>`__: You'll use this repo as a catch-all for issues where you're not sure where else to put them
* `Our enhancement proposals repo <https://github.com/conda-forge/cfep/issues>`__: You'll use the enhancement proposals repo if you're interested in substantially changing the way conda-forge operates.

Discussion Forum
-----------------

The primary discussion areas that you will engage with is

* `discourse forum <https://conda.discourse.group/c/pkg-building/conda-forge/25>`__: We are using discourse as our main communication channel. To ask a question regarding usage of conda we encourage posting to our Discourse forum.


Gitter and Element
-------------------------

The main chat rooms that you'll interact with are

* `gitter: general <https://gitter.im/conda-forge/conda-forge.github.io>`__: Our general chat room for all things conda-forge. Pretty much any question can be asked here and others in the community may be able to help.
  Move stuff to an issue tracker if your question isn't getting resolved.
* `gitter: core/private <https://gitter.im/conda-forge/core>`__: Private chat for the @conda-forge/core team to discuss continued operations and improvements to conda-forge.
* `gitter: power pc <https://gitter.im/conda-forge-ppc64le/Lobby>`__: Public chat room for all things related to building for power pc (IBM) systems.
* `gitter: bot subteam <https://gitter.im/conda-forge/regro-cf-autotick-bot>`__: Public chat room for all things related to the conda-forge automation infrastructure.
  Our automation infrastructure is colloquially referred to as "the bot".
* `gitter: compilers <https://gitter.im/conda-forge/conda-forge-compilers>`__: Public chat room focused on the conda-forge compiler stack.
* `element: conda-forge-space <https://app.element.io/#/room/#conda-forge-space:matrix.org>`__: An element space listing all conda-forge rooms.
