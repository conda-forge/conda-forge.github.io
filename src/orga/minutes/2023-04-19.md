### Your `__new__()` agenda items

- [X] (JK) Windows ARM64
    - (SD) Working on new Windows ARM hardware
        - like Surface Pro X
        - CPython building on Windows ARM (tier 3)
        - Currently GHA doesn't have native Windows ARM support
        - How to enable developers?
            - Interested in enabling conda-forge to build packages
            - Easy to give resources to one org (conda-forge fits the bill)
        - What would be needed?
            - Dev time (Finn dev w/Steve would be contributing)
            - Hardware?
                - Easiest path: https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/products/dev-box/
                - Could also ship physical machines
            - Can cross-compile (have cross-compilers)
            - (MRB) Does LIEF work on Windows ARM?
                - (SD) Ordinary PE with another instruction set
            - (JRG/MRB) Migrator? Doable
            - (JRG) Constructor stack? NSIS, pyinstaller (conda-standalone)
              - SD: x86 installers should work
              - JRG: We need changes in constructor to support "cross-installers", but not too complicated (export CONDA_SUBDIR?)
            - ED: what's needed?
                - 1 or more "core sponsor(s)" of the work that can ensure things aren't block 
                  on the CF side
                - someone that provides hardware
                - someone that has the time to hack on this problem
                - someone at Anaconda that can help push changes into the 
                  various tools that need to be updated to support the new platform
            -
        - Thoughts? :)
            - (JL) Introducing new platform is non-trivial
                - Want to make sure this is somehow funded
                - Maybe NF as a conduit (SDG or ...?) for Conda / cf
            - (MRB) How did we do this in the past (aarch64, pp64le, OSX arm)?
                - (IF) Linux aarch64 was Jonathan Helmus ( https://github.com/jjhelmus ) starting with Rasberry Pi and going from there
                - (IF) Can bootstrap
            - (JL) 
            - (IF) Keeping things green (once a package works we'd like it to keep working)
            - (IF) A few more Azure jobs? Particularly if Windows ARM supports multiple version
        - (MRB) Cross-compiling is probably most efficient approach (like what MacOS ARM uses)
        - (MRB) ~~Let's create a~~ tracking issue
            - https://github.com/conda-forge/conda-forge.github.io/issues/1940
        - 
    - (CHL) Tracking ecosystem support as [conda/conda#11472](https://github.com/conda/conda/issues/11472)
        - PR [conda/conda#11778](https://github.com/conda/conda/pull/11778): add `win-arm64` as platform in `conda`
        - PR [conda/conda-build#4579](https://github.com/conda/conda-build/pull/4579): add `win-arm64` as platform in `conda-build`
        - [ContinuumIO/anaconda-issues#12957](https://github.com/ContinuumIO/anaconda-issues/issues/12957): add `win-arm64` as platform in anaconda.org
- [X] (JK) New CTK packages / CUDA 12
    - Most packages up (few remaining / some follow up items)
    - `cuda-version`
        - https://github.com/conda-forge/cudatoolkit-feedstock/pull/89
        - https://github.com/conda-forge/conda-forge-repodata-patches-feedstock/pull/435
    - Opening CUDA 12 migrator
        - Package layout changes:
            - Document?
            - Message?
            - Incremental rollout?
    - (Longer-term) CUDA 11 backport?
        - New style packages on older CUDA versions
        - What version to start with (`nvidia` channel has `11.4`)?
        - `cudatoolkit` becomes metapackage?
        - Potential to drop some CUDA specific things
            - Docker images
            - conda-forge-ci-setup simplification
- [x] (HV) Bump to GCC 12 / LLVM 15 (should not be controversial, just needs a merge)
  - https://github.com/conda-forge/conda-forge-pinning-feedstock/pull/4215
- [x] (HV) RHEL 8-compatible sysroot (most likely AlmaLinux, matching [manylinux_2_28](https://github.com/pypa/manylinux/issues/1282))
  - sync requirements / naming with Anaconda (once aligned, I'll try to start raising PRs)
      - (CHL) Anaconda naming convention is `sysroot_${subdir}=${glibc_version}` (so probably `sysroot_linux-64=2.28`)
      - use cdt_name = "conda_2_28"
      - pull CDTs out of alma8
  - see Matthew's initial [TODO list](https://github.com/conda-forge/conda-forge.github.io/issues/1432#issuecomment-1512315951).
- [x] (HV) Boost harmonization
  - Can we agree on the plan in https://github.com/conda-forge/boost-cpp-feedstock/issues/137?
  - If so, I can start raising PRs 
  - agreed to plan with name libboost-python for anaconda py-boost and conda-forge boost
