### Your new agenda items

### Stuff from last week that we didn't get to
* [x] (ED) Welcome packets for new members and contributors?
    * new contributors to staged-recipes 
        * stickers mailed to an address of their choosing?
    * Staged-recipes
        * new contributors plus a mug
    * Subteams?
        * As above plus any subteam specific stuff (e.g., maybe we need a bot sticker)
    * Core
        * staged-recipes plus a tshirt
    * Concerns:
        * cost
        * who would mail stuff
        * privacy around people giving us a mailing address
        * https://shop.spreadshirt.com/numfocus/
        * https://shop.spreadshirt.com/numfocus/conda-forge+official+logo?idea=5bce3b332051763003022d31
    * How to implement:
        * original conda-forge mugs were a hit.

* [x] (KK) Remove deprecation/warning of pre-link scripts in conda-build
    * Warning currently swallows messages from our (NVIDIA) testing
    * Used in conda forge packages currently according to jakirkham
    * Would be good to allow packages with proprietary licenses to display some message before package is actually installed
        * NVIDIA legal would prefer this for CUDA related packages, and want to pave the way for shipping compiler, headers, and other EULA protected bits
    * Pre-link issue: https://github.com/conda/conda/issues/7452
    * Maybe add messaging functionality to conda (https://github.com/conda/conda/issues/10118)
    * FF: I'll write a Small Grant Proposal for NumFOCUS to see if we can get fresh blood on this
        * https://docs.google.com/document/d/1kdeXLbsxQ95qGVeYpGoqEIwcNYx82L-okgXY_8tBAug/edit

* https://docs.google.com/document/d/1dEXQsrXM5kBW6ARLpsVGRQltVxQVbVkjmXbBh8LnHac/edit#heading=h.cs380pc1x0vk

    * INACTIVE - Merge in with some inactive-esque status?

      on a temporary basis (i.e., until the migration has ended).
