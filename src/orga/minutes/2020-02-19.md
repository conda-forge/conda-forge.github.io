# 2020-02-19 conda-forge core meeting 


## Attendees

## Agenda

### Your agenda items

* (ED) Recurring Anaconda update on what's going on on our side.
    * CF summit this year: Scipy? 
        * Anaconda can help cover travel costs
        * scheduling challenges to work through. 
        * overlapping tutorials or overlapping sprints?
        * maybe one day at the start and a half day at the end? 
        * Second day of sprints not too many people show up anyway.
        * proposal: full-day meeting second tutorial day, half day meeting second day of sprints.
    * conda / conda-build update, if any
        * 
* (ED) Thread about .conda package format on twitter 
    * https://twitter.com/mrocklin/status/1228750299373817856
    * Eric: Set up follow-on chat to figure out how to move this forward.
* Miniforge installers for platforms where Anaconda, Inc provides Miniconda
    * https://github.com/conda-forge/miniforge/releases/tag/4.8.2-
    * As CF core we had voted to NOT to x64. They're doing nice work, so it's not like we're mad at them. The biggest question is that it seems like there are parts of the CF ecosystem that are operating outside of the decisions we make as core.
        * We had proposed using conda-pack for standalone CI usage. Host the conda-pack'd conda-forge x86 "miniconda" on azure / s3 somewhere.
    * Eric TODO: Work with Scopatz to get the right people in the room to talk through these concerns.

* TODO: Track votes 
    * Eric to sync with Marius on some github strategies for tracking who participates in the voting

### Subteam updates

#### Bot
* (Eric) Do we need further discussion of Automerging?
    * Tradeoff discussion from last meeting was "increase risk of bad packages and increasing throughput"
    * (CJ) Discussion of what we can do to minimize risk of bad packages, what is the spectrum of risk tolerance among us (eg. if we had X capability I would feel comfortable with automerge)
        * Attempt at using pip check, issues with that approach
        * Advanced conda skeleton?
* (AS) dynamodb + keybase.io
    * terraform in shared, encrypted git repo on keybase.io
    * pieces of bot moving to dynamodb
    * pieces of other bits of infrastructure can move to keybase w/ terraform as well (herkou, keys in repos, etc)
