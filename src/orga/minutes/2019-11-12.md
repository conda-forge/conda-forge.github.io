# 2019-11-12 conda-forge core meeting 


## Attendees

## Agenda

### Your agenda items
* Qt update strategies. Marius said he was going to talk with Microsoft at the Numfocus summit / Pydata NYC. We agreed that we'd get updates from Marius at this dev meeting.
    * Context: We should be building Qt more regularly. How do we achieve this? Provisioning Windows Azure VMs seems like the best path forward. 
        * We'd need to make an Azure org (or whatever their term is) and then distribute credentials
        * We should consider talking to Microsoft about help doing this on Azure. 
        * Marius will run point on these conversations this week at NumFocus Summit and PyData.
        * Get updates from Marius at next dev meeting.
* (John/Eric) Aligning on GPU packages between CF and defaults
    * (Eric) Currently working internally and then with Josh to align on funding half time developer on distribution team for the rapids GPU needs.

* Reach out to NumFocus to figure out legal ramifications of not including licenses in files.
    * Suggestion to changing linter to error when license is missing, can still merge  with a failure.
    * Can include license file which mentions that license is unclear.
    * https://github.com/conda-forge/conda-smithy/pull/1102#issuecomment-553503902

* Advertise AMD GPU support.
    * AMD GPU runtime is in conda-forge now. Only need a recent Linux kernel in the user machine (And a supported AMD GPU of course)
    * write a note to NumFOCUS newsletter

* Should conda-forge be ping-ing maintainers for projects who's packages are being added to staged recipes?
    * eg. torchvision issue
    * Find the right wording to ping people without "bothering" them too much.
    * Invite to feedstock rather than in staged-recipes
    * What if maintainer says no, or asks to take the package down?

    This is an email I got when one of my (Jonathan's) packages was added to Fedora. 
    The author might have contacts me only about the issues.
    
    Greetings from a fellow NMR spectroscopist. In my role as a Fedora
    packager, I have built nmrglue for Fedora and Centos (or RHEL,
    Scientific linux, etc,). Users of these distributions can now install
    nmrglue using their respective package management tools.

    I am writing to you to bring up two "issues".
    ...

* Getting more contributors to conda-forge:
    * Should we do outchreachy with part of our funds? (GSoC but with our own funds. Higher contributor "conversion" rate than GSoC.)
    * Send stickers/t-shirts to reviewers on staged-recipes.

* Vote for Staged reciepes reminder!

* Python 3.8 migration
    * https://github.com/pulls?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is%3Aopen+is%3Apr+archived%3Afalse+org%3Aconda-forge+-review%3Achanges_requested+-repo%3Aconda-forge%2Fstaged-recipes+author%3Aregro-cf-autotick-bot+Rebuild+python38+
