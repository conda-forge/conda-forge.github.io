### Active votes

### Your __new__() agenda items

    * https://blog.trailofbits.com/2022/11/15/python-wheels-abi-abi3audit/
    * [X] Sounds feasible with some work, Jaime to post issue on website repo for follow-ups

* [x] (MRB) cleaning up bots and secrets
    * [x] moving all bot tokens, passwords, etc. out of keybase to 1password

    * [ ] todo:
        * [ ] john to post note on issue that we will discuss again in january 11
* [x] (HV) cross-compiling CUDA
    * [ ] new effort in staged-recipes is adding 11.8, but we would need 11.2 (quoth Isuru)
    * [ ] is there an alternative to https://github.com/conda-forge/conda-forge-ci-setup-feedstock/pull/210 ?
    * [ ] if not, can we finalize that PR?
    * [ ] would help a lot on CUDA+aarch jobs for feedstocks that can cross-compile
        * e.g. arrow now has 16 jobs x 2 abi branches that run into 6h timeout about 50% of the time (c.f. x-compilation: ~1h)
        * arrow-cpp-feedstock/main dropped CUDA+aarch, pending https://github.com/conda-forge/arrow-cpp-feedstock/pull/899)
        * Planning to move forward with conda-forge-ci-setup PR
        * Needs some permission fixes to Docker images
        * In the future, new CUDA packages + cuda-compat could solve this, but not right away
* [x] (JK) staged-recipes
