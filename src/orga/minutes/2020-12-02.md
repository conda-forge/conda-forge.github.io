    * current approvals?
    * Whenever updated numbers land, please screenshare and show the budget.
        * Link is in Keybase (numfocus_spreadsheets.txt)

    * Markus for staged-recipes

* [ ] (MRB/ED/SC) Roadmap / Funding
    * **WILL RESUME NEXT WEEK WITH A SPECIAL MEETING**
    * goal is to spend 15 minutes each core meeting for ~3-4 meetings to discuss this
        * Save last 15 minutes for this.
    * https://hackmd.io/0zGSUS71SbOdBsdLtDmGjg
    * notes will get added to hackmd above
    * MRB will collate into a document of sorts
    * some resources
        1. Some numbers:
            * https://github.com/conda-forge/by-the-numbers/blob/master/conda-forge-timelines.ipynb
            * conda-forge has added about 3k feedstocks per year in 2019 and will in 2020
            * the growth in the amount of data we store appears to be accelerating
        2. risk measurements
            * CJ deserves all of the credit for this idea
            * https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ADNNauwVZWUsEdlh5aEg0OLjyDWvCX7PLoo-K34EqcM/edit#gid=0
    * going to skip today due to my own constraints
    * TODO:
        * Everyone take a look at the pypa roadmap:
        * fill out the risk measurement spread sheet:
          https://github.com/psf/fundable-packaging-improvements/blob/master/FUNDABLES.md

#### From previous meeting(s)

* [x] (MRB/IF) pybind11 packaging
    * issue: https://github.com/conda-forge/conda-forge-pinning-feedstock/pull/849#issuecomment-727207060
    * we agreed to a pybind11-abi metapackage that
        * is versioned with the pybind11 internal abi
        * has a run export on itself
        * pybind11 will have a run_constrained on its version
        * can be optionally added to host envs by users to enforce ABI compat as needed
    * IF: this has the side effect of enforcing one global pybind11 ABI

### Your __new__() agenda items

* [X] (Filipe) Kaleido PR is still pending: https://github.com/conda-forge/staged-recipes/pull/12747
    * ED: can we merge and then fix it later?
    * FF: Let's do it!

* [x] (Filipe) We need a new conda-build release that fixes the prefix issue on Windows or we need to use a really old version there.
    * effects pyqt and sip
    * IF: we should backport
    * FF: if soon, then no need
    * CHL: should release in next two or three weeks

* [x] (CJ) NumFOCUS is having a legal Q&A, do we have concrete questions for them?

* [x] (CJ) Depfinder audit results
    * Various improvements have gone into the depfinder based dependency inspection system.
    * This jupyter notebook shows some of the results
        * https://github.com/conda-forge/by-the-numbers/blob/master/audit_accuracy.ipynb
    * There are some important subtle points around depfinder
        * A feedstock is "accurate" (from depfinders perspective) if all the conda run requirements are either found as required or questionable imports. Questionable imports are imports obscured so that they might not be run (inside a function, behind a try except, etc.)
        * The audit is run on the source code itself, not the resulting `site-packages` so files we wouldn't otherwise ship (tests, examples, etc.) may be drawn into the audit.
        * The audit doesn't have much visability to optional files so we assume that all files (and their associated imports) are required. This can cause depfinder to think conda-forge is underspecified.
        * If a feedstock requires a pkg that clobbers other pkgs then we may loose requirements since those imports are formally supplied by the clobbering pkg
    * These audits could form the basis of efforts to
        * fix our depenencies where we are missing required dependencies and transitive dependencies
        * fix upstream requirements specifications and determine how reliable upstream specs are at the pkg requirement level
        * help maintainers make informed decisions around dependency updates
    * Audit source code: https://github.com/regro/cf-scripts/blob/master/conda_forge_tick/audit.py#L39
    * Import maps: https://github.com/regro/libcfgraph/tree/master/import_maps

* [x] (MRB) packaging ray
    * we have a working recipe: https://github.com/conda-forge/staged-recipes/pull/11160
    * are we happy with it?
    * KK: will push out to ppl I know who care about this

* [x] (MRB) off-label github actions usage
    * we have at least two feedstocks that are using github actions in the conda-forge org for their custom CI scripts
    * we cannot support every feedstock doing this
    * I sent them a note: https://github.com/conda-forge/pangeo-notebook-feedstock/issues/49
    * We need a policy.
        * I put a draft policy here: https://github.com/conda-forge/conda-forge.github.io/pull/1199
    * TODO
        * MRB: put up for a 50% vote

* [x] (MRB) artifact-validation and clobbering in the prefix
    * see here: https://github.com/conda-forge/artifact-validation
    * this works as follows
        1. when a package copy request is sent to the heroku service, it sends the artifact to be validated via a GHA repo dispatch event
        2. this event runs a validation CI job on github actions (https://github.com/conda-forge/artifact-validation/actions?query=workflow%3Avalidate-artifact)
        3. the validation job downloads the artifact, double checks the MD5 checksum, and then inspects its files for paths not
           allowed using a set of glob filters
    * the glob filters are listed in yaml files which indicate which paths are protected and which packages are allowed to write to those paths
        * we use a combination of hand specified paths and generated paths
        * by hand ones are here: https://github.com/conda-forge/artifact-validation/tree/master/validate_yamls
        * generated ones are here: https://github.com/conda-forge/artifact-validation/tree/master/generated_validate_yamls
        * we use the list of files in libcfgraph to generate the protected paths
    * we also continuously scan artifacts using libcfgraph and downloads
        * https://github.com/conda-forge/artifact-validation/actions?query=workflow%3Ascan
    * we also update the filters as new packages are added
        * https://github.com/conda-forge/artifact-validation/actions?query=workflow%3Aupdate-filters
    * next steps
        * mark invalid artifacts as broken: https://github.com/conda-forge/artifact-validation/blob/master/scan_data/invalid_packages.yaml
        * do uploads to anaconda.org from the GHA validation jobs and don't upload invalid artifacts
        * expand the set of filters
        * FF: send some data to PyPA

* [x] (CHL) conda & conda-forge being used in IoT, embedded, etc.
    * Anaconda curious if anyone is using, plans to, or wants to use conda and its package ecosystem in such environments; if so, what needs to be done to (better) support it.
    * Answers:
        * Robotics
        * NVIDIA Jetsons & RAPIDS signal processing lib

    * INACTIVE - Merge in with some inactive-esque status?
