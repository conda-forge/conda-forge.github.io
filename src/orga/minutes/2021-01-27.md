                * we want to change metadata and change some default settings (swap intel openmp and llvm openmp)
                * use different blas exports in MKL
    * Andres w/ compilers
        * we can start fresh on recipes

            * activation calls setvars.sh
        * IF: just icc or DPCPP?
            * answer: right now ICC first and then DPCPP
        * IF:
            * need stuff in ctng packages
            * is there a deactivation for setvars.sh?
        * AG:
            * what needs to happen wrt to conda?
        * IF:
            * need env to be the same after we deactivate
        * MRB: can we reuse ctng for icc?
            * IF: we are not doing this - you are WRONG matt!
        * IF: need icc to use our sysroot
        * AG: what about fortran?
            * MRB: do C/C++ for now and then fortran later
        * IF: we'll have two packages
            * icc_impl_{{ target_platform}} : repack binary packages
            * icc_{{ target_platform}}: activation scripts

* [ ] (FF) GSoC 2021 plans
    * Filipe won't be able to manage this one this year. If anyone is willing, take over from Filipe.

* [ ] (FF) Meetings times, should we send a new doodle to try to include more people?
    * [ ] go back to fortnightly
    * [ ] send a poll to move to alternate time slot with conda community meeting
* [ ] (FF) Should pypy migrations be on automerge?
    * we were careful with R
    * merging PRs is a burden to people
    * FF thinks it will be fine
    * IF automerge will give access to a lot of our feedstocks
* [ ] (MP) How is the PyPy 3.7 migration going?
    * 3.6: done (1328) in-pr (412) not-solvable   (0) awaiting-parents (423) bot-error  (5)

    * INACTIVE - Merge in with some inactive-esque status?
    * Needs new champion. Thanks for your work on this pkgw! Has unaddressed comments from pkgw as from Jan 10, 2020
    Solved: Let's defer and keep the "mixed model" we have now.

* [cfep-06](https://github.com/conda-forge/conda-forge-enhancement-proposals/pull/9) Staged-recipes review lifecycle
    * INACTIVE - Merge in with some inactive-esque status?
    * Lingering comment from @saraedum. @jakirkham, can you reply? Has unadressed comment from @saraedum from Jan 8, 2020
    * (MRB) The stalebot has solved the worst of the issues here. I think we could defer this one permanently.
    Solved: defer in favor of the stale bot for now.

* [cfep-15](https://github.com/conda-forge/conda-forge-enhancement-proposals/pull/15) Feedstock statuses, unmaintained
    * INACTIVE - Merge in with some inactive-esque status?
    * Needs another review. Has unaddressed updates from pkgw as of Jan 11, 2020

    * Stalled debate about implementation details between Isuru, CJ and Matt

      on a temporary basis (i.e., until the migration has ended).

* [cfep-19](https://github.com/conda-forge/cfep/pull/35) Pinning epochs
