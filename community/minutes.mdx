# Core team meetings

We hold biweekly meetings every second Wednesday from 17:00-18:00 (UTC). Feel free to stop by!
Up-to-date invites are always available in the [conda.org community calendar](https://conda.org/community/calendar). 
Look for the `[conda-forge] core meeting` events!

We encourage contributors to join the meetings and learn more about and from the community.

## Setup

Our [meeting notes](https://conda-forge.org/community/minutes/) record important points discussed during the meetings and serve as a record for upcoming meetings. 
We make use of [HackMD](https://hackmd.io/) and a [template](https://github.com/conda-forge/conda-forge.github.io/blob/main/misc/DEV_MEETING_TEMPLATE.md) to create the meeting notes.

We use a Github Actions [workflow][gha-workflow] to create an automated PR with the meeting notes
template for each session, which is automatically published to our HackMD team account. During the
meeting, attendees will edit the HackMD document. After the meeting, the document is saved and the
PR is synced with the changes by adding the `sync-hackmd-notes` label. Once satisfied, the PR is
merged and the website will be updated with the new meeting notes.
