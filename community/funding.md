# Funding efforts

If you want to fund some work in conda-forge, please check our list of "fundable items".
These issues are marked with the `fundable` label and can be found across all the conda-forge repositories.

The quickest way to find them is to use this [Github issue search for `org:conda-forge label:fundable`](https://github.com/search?q=label%3Afundable+org%3Aconda-forge+&ref=opensearch&type=issues).

If you want to propose a new fundable item for a particular part of the project, find the relevant repository and fill up the "Fundable" template. If you are not sure of which repository is the most adequate, default to [`conda-forge/conda-forge.github.io`](https://github.com/conda-forge/conda-forge.github.io/issues/new/choose).

conda-forge can also be found in [OpenCollective](https://opencollective.com/conda-forge), where
you can:

- Browse current and past [transactions](https://opencollective.com/conda-forge/transactions)
- Subscribe with [recurring contributions](https://opencollective.com/conda-forge/contribute/backer-30154/checkout?interval=month&amount=5)
- Make [one-time donations](https://opencollective.com/conda-forge/donate?interval=oneTime&amount=20&name=&legalName=&email=)
