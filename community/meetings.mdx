# Community meetings

We participate in the conda community calls in a weekly basis.
These take place every Wednesday at a rotating time: either 3PM or 5PM UTC.

We encourage contributors to join the meetings and learn more about and from the community.
Look for the events in the calendar below!

## Calendar

import Calendar from '@site/src/components/Calendar';

## Setup

Our [meeting notes](https://conda-forge.org/community/minutes/) record important points discussed
during the meetings and serve as a record for upcoming meetings.

The `conda/governance` repository uses a Github Actions workflow to create an automated PR with the
meeting notes template for each session, which is automatically published to a HackMD team account.
You are welcome to add your talking points to the agenda once this PR is published a few days
before.

During the meeting, attendees will edit the HackMD document to take notes and record decisions.
After the meeting, the document is saved and the `conda/governance` PR is synced with the changes
by adding the `sync-hackmd-notes` label. Once satisfied, the PR is merged and conda.org will be
updated with the new meeting notes.

The notes are copied to [Community> Meetings> Minutes archive](/community/minutes/) shortly after
for convenience and discoverability.
