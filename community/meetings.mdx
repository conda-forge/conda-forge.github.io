# Community meetings

We hold a series of recurring meetings:

- `⚫ [conda-forge] core meeting`: every second Wednesday, alternating between 17:00-18:00 and 14:00-15:00 (UTC). Despite the name, they are open to everyone. Feel free to stop by! Meeting notes available at [Minutes](minutes.mdx).
- `⚫ [conda-forge] bot sync`: first Friday of the month at 15:00 (UTC). These are technical meetings meant for infrastructure and tooling contributors. Meeting notes available in [HackMD](https://hackmd.io/@conda-forge/BJE6E1VY2).

We encourage contributors to join the meetings and learn more about and from the community. Look for the events in the calendar below!

## Setup

Our [meeting notes](https://conda-forge.org/community/minutes/) record important points discussed during the meetings and serve as a record for upcoming meetings.
We make use of [HackMD](https://hackmd.io/) and a [template](https://github.com/conda-forge/conda-forge.github.io/blob/main/misc/DEV_MEETING_TEMPLATE.md) to create the meeting notes.

We use a Github Actions [workflow][gha-workflow] to create an automated PR with the meeting notes
template for each session, which is automatically published to our HackMD team account. During the
meeting, attendees will edit the HackMD document. After the meeting, the document is saved and the
PR is synced with the changes by adding the `sync-hackmd-notes` label. Once satisfied, the PR is
merged and the website will be updated with the new meeting notes.
