## Attendees
 
## Agenda

### Standing items

* [x] intros for new folks on the call
* [x] (CJ) budget


### Your new agenda items

* [ ] (ED) @sylvain: Any updates from OVH on the windows VM?

* [ ] (AS) qgpu - GPU build agents. 
    * Drone or Azure? Drone is a simple go executable and you can run it in docker. Azure build agent is heavy weight?
    * Pick one and go

* [x] (CJ) Version bumps offering dependency analysis as hints
    * Hinting system for bot for what we think the dependencies should be based on the analysis of the source code
    * Currently using depfinder. Only works for Python.
    * Around 6000 packages have been analyzed
    * For 30% of the packages depfinder and CF metadata agree
    * https://github.com/regro/cf-scripts/pull/1126
    * https://github.com/regro/cf-graph-countyfair/tree/master/audits/depfinder
    * https://github.com/regro/cf-graph-countyfair/blob/master/audits/depfinder/_net_audit.json
    * Can we do this for C packages?
        * Post-build steps do something to the DSOs that are created. Can't do it beforehand. You can check after the build.
        * (CJ) Can the C builds publish this information?
        * (JJ) Maybe?
        * (FF) C builds will fail if the dependency isn't there at build-time. Python won't.
    * Can we do this for R?
        * Get metadata from CRAN and update 
        * Use skeleton to get the R dependencies. Grayskull doesn't handle R recipes yet.
    * Number of packages: 6k is Python, 2k is R. Between these two we'll have 80% of the ecosystem covered.
    * (MB) How should we handle information loss? Optional dependencies - maybe capture as a comment in the meta.yaml? Version bounds on the dependencies?
        * Optional dependencies - capture in extra section of info
    * (CJ, addendum) Mapping between conda-forge, pypi and imports: https://github.com/regro/cf-graph-countyfair/blob/master/mappings/pypi/name_mapping.yaml
        * Note that the mapping is imperfect, since it relies on the conda-forge `test: imports:` metadata.
        * It would be nice if we could get this directly from the package/source

* [x] (KK) cudatoolkit package in conda-forge
    * Still only ship pieces that are redistributable per the EULA (shared libraries)
    * nvbug #: 3052604
        * Internal NVIDIA system used for tracking these types of approvals
        * Link (only works on NVIDIA intranet): http://nvbugs/3052604/
    * (KK) Approval to host the same version of cudatoolkit in conda-forge as is on defaults
        * Maybe don't just copy the recipe from defaults. Or at least revisit
        * Would like to have a few Nvidia folks maintain the recipe. Over time migrate it to the CUDA team at Nvidia.
        * (JK) Maybe use variants to maintain all of the versions in one branch
    * (JJ) What about cudnn? Can we move that over to CF? 
    * (KK) All of the cuda libs should be shippable from CF. As long as we can show the EULA with pre-link or post-link. Internal at NVIDIA is fine with just having this as a pre-link script messaging mechanism.
    * (IF) Have you considered splitting up the recipe where all the different libraries end up in different conda installable units?
        * (KK) Yes that's the long term plan. Were trying to do the windows side. Their team is mostly focused on Linux. 
        * (JJ) If we do end up doing Windows, then make sure we have all of the windows versions. Strict channel priority is harmful if you have only one or two packages available versus default having many.

* [x] (CHL) FYI: conda 4.8.4 behavior change --- virtual package constraints now enforced
    * Will definitely impact many CUDA packages (e.g., can no longer install CUDA 10-dependent packages on CUDA 9.x systems); e.g., https://github.com/conda/conda/issues/10152
    * Will be working on solver messaging because errors are usually opaque and irrelevant
    * There's an env var that you can set to change conda's view on the cuda version: CONDA_OVERRIDE_CUDA


### Stuff from last week that we didn't get to

Who is taking these action items?

* [x] Dropping python 3.6
    * need an announcement cycle
    * should we follow NEP29? NEP29 + 6 months?
        * https://numpy.org/neps/nep-0029-deprecation_policy.html#drop-schedule
    * End of life for Python 3.x versions:
        * https://devguide.python.org/#status-of-python-branches
    * No pypy for 3.7
        * https://foss.heptapod.net/pypy/pypy/-/wikis/py3.7%20status
    * Action Item: Send to issue (get input from pypy team and others)
    * (CJ) py36 should stick around until pypy comes out (it's in the near horizon). That's going to be soon, so it's not like we're keeping 
    * TODO: (ED) Python versions:
        * Keep 3 Python versions
        * Move off of old versions with the community moves (when scipy, matplotlib, numpy, etc.)
        * We can keep an old version around temporarily if we need to (e.g., pypy doesnt have py37 yet)

    * (MRB) The stalebot has solved the worst of the issues here. I think we could defer this one permanently.

* [cfep-10](https://github.com/conda-forge/conda-forge-enhancement-proposals/pull/15) Feedstock statuses, unmaintained
    * INACTIVE - Merge in with some inactive-esque status?

    * **UPDATE 2020-07-22**: We in principle have agreement to render the extra pinnings needed directly in the feedstock 
      on a temporary basis (i.e., until the migration has ended).

    * who's the POC for CF <> Anaconda, CF <> NumFocus, CF <> Azure
    * who's the POC for the various subteams?
    * Informal information: roles, day jobs, bios, the whole nine yards, why you're here, etc.
    * Public or internal? I don't really care either way. Anyone feel strongly one way or the other?
    * opt-in to public bios
