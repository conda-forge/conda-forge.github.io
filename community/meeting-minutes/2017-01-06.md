**Standing Items**

*   How many repos? ~1400
*   How many contributors? ~300
*   CFEP status

**Notes**

*   Options for packaging X.org libraries.

        *   Bundle them together [PR#2068](https://github.com/conda-forge/staged-recipes/pull/2068).
    *   Use build customization to do one build and split out multiple packages.

*   Drop numpy 1.10 but leave Python 3.4 for a while longer.
*   John will build Qt 4 on OS X.
*   Ray will build Qt 5 with jpeg 9* soon on defaults and our problem will go away.
*   conda-build 2

        *   do not wait for the remaining packages that needs long prefix
    *   merge [conda forge/conda forge build setup feedstock#40](https://github.com/conda-forge/conda-forge-build-setup-feedstock/issues/40)
    *   investigate why pestc is not uploading

*   Move MACOSX_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET variable to conda-build-setup and modify the CFEP to reflect that.

**Agenda**

*   pkgw would like to discuss bundling X.org client libraries in the conda-forge stack, as per [PR#2068](https://github.com/conda-forge/staged-recipes/pull/2068). The PR has everything bundled into a giant tarball for simplicity; gqmelo posted [a set of recipes](https://github.com/ESSS/xorg-recipes) that splits each library out.

*   Defaults  channel libpng and jpeg updates: scheduled for 1Q 2017.  Continuum  requests closer collaboration on future api/abi incompatible updates to  core libraries.

*   One pinning scheme for both defaults and conda-forge?
*   That would be ideal.  Hopefully we can head that way.

*   Drop  Python 3.4. Now that conda-forge have Qt 4+jpeg9* on Windows the Python  3.5+Windows users can migrate from Python 3.4 to 3.5.

*   Do MinGW compile things that play well with Python 3.5/MSVC 2015 yet? AFAICT this is still an [issue](http://bugs.python.org/issue4709).

*   Drop numpy 110
*   Upload of Qt 4 for OS X

*   Have a VM I'm willing to use to do this. Details [here](https://github.com/boxcutter/macos).

*   Build and upload of Qt 5+jpeg 9* for all platforms
*   PyCon  2017. Just submitted a place holder talk as we lost the tutorial  deadline and the talk deadline is today. Anyone interested in  participating please get in touch.

*   Re-rendering channel improvements. ( [conda forge/conda smithy#401](https://github.com/conda-forge/conda-smithy/pull/401) )

*   conda-build 2 ( [conda forge/conda forge build setup feedstock#40](https://github.com/conda-forge/conda-forge-build-setup-feedstock/issues/40) )
*   Travis CI image change. ( [conda forge/conda forge enhancement proposals#6](https://github.com/conda-forge/conda-forge-enhancement-proposals/pull/6) )
*   conda-smithy and conda 4.2 ( [conda forge/conda smithy#394](https://github.com/conda-forge/conda-smithy/pull/394) )
