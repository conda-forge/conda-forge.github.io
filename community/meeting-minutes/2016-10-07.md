**Notes**

*   conda build 2.0

        *   cmake seems to be having issue
    *   Patch? the packages which need to be rebuilt with conda build 2.0 before switching all feedstocks to 2.0
    *   conda-build-setup should have whitelist to do something else?
    *   Only need to rebuild packages with short prefixes, shouldn't need to do anything special
    *   Packages that need to be rebuilt [conda forge/conda forge.github.io#171](https://github.com/conda-forge/conda-forge.github.io/issues/171)

*   conda & conda-env (conda-build?)

        *   conda-env is rolled into conda in recent versions, conda-env package now a placeholder
    *   Need to pin older version of conda with conda-env<2.6 and newer version with conda-env > 2.6
    *   Get rid of conda-env recipe?
    *   Currently not building conda-build, need conda-build 2.0 to build

*   Travis CI VM changes

        *   Changed default OS X image to 10.11 with XCode 7.3
    *   Fixed in conda-smithy by specifying what image to use
    *   Travis will drop image at end of the month... we need a solution
    *   Should look at new image and see if it meets our needs.
    *   May need to set environment variable to continue to target 10.9, but may need to install own SDK
    *   What versions of OS X are being used and what should we support? 10.9 good choice for minimum?
    *   Enhancement proposal to outline how we manage changes to what we support (3.4, numpy 1.10, etc)
    *   jpeg8 to jpeg9
    *   Discuss on GitHub issue until 21st then decide.
    *   Ray will try to get Anaconda.org usage stats.

*   Updates from Michael on GitLab based CI
