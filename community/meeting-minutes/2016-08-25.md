*   New core devs? 

**Notes**

*   Invite  Peter M. Landwehr (pmlandwehr) to be involved with review of  staged-recipes.  Should we give these type of people a title, Filipe  will reach out to.
*   Governing Open Source Projects at Scale: Lessons from Wikipedia's Growing Pains | Staurt Geiger [](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZSQJYEVcMWM&index=89&list=PLYx7XA2nY5Gf37zYZMw6OqGFRPjB1jCy6)[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZSQJYEVcMWM&index=89&list=PLYx7XA2nY5Gf37zYZMw6OqGFRPjB1jCy6](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZSQJYEVcMWM&index=89&list=PLYx7XA2nY5Gf37zYZMw6OqGFRPjB1jCy6)
*   Enhancement proposal document, Jonathan has notes will write these up later today.
*   Governance document - help is welcomed.  Also "whos who" or "about" page. [](https://conda-forge.github.io/#about)[https://conda-forge.github.io/](https://conda-forge.github.io/#about)[#about](https://conda-forge.hackpad.com/ep/search/?q=%23about&via=2YkV96cvxPG)

        *   This page could be expanded, should mentioned these meeting.

*   Removing items from agenda

        *   Prioritize items on agenda which we should/must talk about.
    *   Cross link items to GitHub issues/discussions

*   Status page: [](https://conda-forge.github.io/status/)[https://conda-forge.github.io/status/](https://conda-forge.github.io/status/)

        *   Linked to "status" repo:  [](https://github.com/conda-forge/status)[https://github.com/conda-forge/status](https://github.com/conda-forge/status)

*   conda-forge code of conduct - Filipe still workin on
*   Many groups working on new build systems: Filipe, Phil, Continuum

        *   Continuum's  plan would allow others to add build workers, perhaps conda-forge could  use these in addition to the CI services, especially for long builds
    *   Organize new meeting to discuss this topic

*   Open sourcing Anaconda Build, should we push to get this released?  

        *   Would be helpful to have our own build system rather than being dependent on CI systems.

*   Travis CI can increase time if we reduce concurrency

        *   Can we switch between longer time and concurrency?  How much work is this?
    *   Probably not going to take offer at the moment
    *   Better to find trusted hardware somewhere
    *   Vagrant for OS X builds, can we look into this

*   Security

        *   If user changes name and someone takes old name can be a security issue:  [](https://groups.google.com/forum/#)[https://groups.google.com/forum/#](https://groups.google.com/forum/#%21topic/rustlang-security-announcements/BK_3gbXhSn4)[!topic/rustlang-security-announcements/BK_3gbXhSn4](https://groups.google.com/forum/#%21topic/rustlang-security-announcements/BK_3gbXhSn4)
    *   Can be solved by using unique user ID rather than GitHub username
    *   Want tokens for Anaconda.org which allow writing to a single package (Phil will push Continuum on this) rather than globally.

*   Metadata unification

        *   Should conda-forge include additional metadata which would make it easier for Continuum to re-use recipes
    *   Should this be required or optional?

                *   Required would likely reduce number of contributors
        *   Will require time/work to add these to all current packages

        *   Add to linter and conda skeleton

                *   Make linter have "warnings" not hard fails

        *   Many of these seem redundant, can we re-use existing metadata?
    *   License file should likely be required

                *   Legal vs. suggested

**Agenda**

*   Marking agenda items as done.
*   Share status page. :) Also figure out how to direct notifications effectively.
*   Enhancement proposal document update.
*   conda-forge code of conduct doc: [](https://docs.google.com/document/d/10dxX0Zse0Rx1HqsxC73Wfsghmy5m8PP8cHuBIOhWKpc/edit)[https://docs.google.com/document/d/10dxX0Zse0Rx1HqsxC73Wfsghmy5m8PP8cHuBIOhWKpc/edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/10dxX0Zse0Rx1HqsxC73Wfsghmy5m8PP8cHuBIOhWKpc/edit)
*   Mention Travis-CI offer for more CI time.

*   We  could look at increasing your build time to 180 mins, but we may need  to decrease your default concurrency from 5 jobs to 3 as you will be  using multiple VMs for a long period at a time.

*   Mention/Discuss Travis Oliphant's [comment](https://github.com/Anaconda-Platform/support/issues/55#issuecomment-242206322) regarding open sourcing Anaconda Build CI.

*   Security

*   Feedstocks philosophy:  Explicit vs implicit / reproducible vs redundant

*   Metadata unification with Continuum - are we OK with adding some fields to about section to match Anaconda standard?

*   Including license file

*   Many recipes don't include the license file.
*   Almost every license has some terms about making the license available.
*   Should we just start requiring this field.
*   Note some developers are not including the license file either.
*   In some cases it has been a struggle to get them to.

*   CUDA/cuDNN update

*   Improving infrastructure

        *   Better workflows with staged-recipes

                *   Fast finish AppVeyor on merge ( [conda forge/staged recipes#1142](https://github.com/conda-forge/staged-recipes/pull/1142) )
        *   Drop Travis CI matrix ( [conda forge/staged recipes#1234](https://github.com/conda-forge/staged-recipes/pull/1234) )
        *   Use CircleCI for feedstock generation ( [conda forge/staged recipes#916](https://github.com/conda-forge/staged-recipes/issues/916) )
        *   Keeping recipes out of PRs ( [conda forge/staged recipes#942](https://github.com/conda-forge/staged-recipes/issues/942) )
        *   Bank work in partial conversion ( [conda forge/staged recipes#915](https://github.com/conda-forge/staged-recipes/issues/915) )

*   Notifications (how do we stay on top of them)
*   MSYS2

        *   Available on defaults - was in conda 4.1.7, but that was pulled.  Coming in 4.1.8.
    *   Discussing Ray Donnelly's work on MSYS2 packages and how we want to use and integrate these into conda-forge.
    *   Some use cases to consider OpenBLAS, FFTW, build tools, others?

*   Binary data

        *   Do we include it in recipes?
    *   What kinds do we allow if any (e.g. icons)?
    *   How do we verify the licensing?
    *   How do we verify that they are safe?

*   Dev releases: Where do they happen?

        *   Do we do them at conda-forge?

                *   Maybe add a label.

        *   Do we let others do them with a feedstock on their own repo?
    *   How do we enforce whatever we decide?

*   Channel mirroring

        *   Can this point be a little bit explained? I thought about this as well and would like to contribute to this point.

                *   Eric Dill has put together a script for copying a package from one channel to another here: [conda forge/conda forge.github.io#134](https://github.com/conda-forge/conda-forge.github.io/pull/134)
        *   I have a really, really crude script that copies all of the packages in one channel to another that I just put at: [](https://gist.github.com/mwcraig/8473cf840f6d29236d6d8af699404555)[https://gist.github.com/mwcraig/8473cf840f6d29236d6d8af699404555](https://gist.github.com/mwcraig/8473cf840f6d29236d6d8af699404555)
        *   conda-build-all can copy from one channel to another: `conda build-all --inspect-channels conda-forge --upload-channels astropy some_packge_recipe` will copy the `some_package`  from the channel conda-forge to  astropy if it can, or build it if it  doesn't exist on conda-forge. Discussion  about what the desired  behavior should be has started at: [SciTools/conda build all#46](https://github.com/SciTools/conda-build-all/issues/46)

*   Feedstock history

        *   Is it sacred?
    *   Do we rebase/force push?

                *   If so, under what conditions?
        *   How do we avoid multiple people doing this simultaneously?

                        *   I don't think you can.

                *   IMHO,  if it's just one author in staged recipes, sure.  If feedstock, no  force push - only to PRs to feedstock.  If people don't mind merge PRs,  it sure is a lot simpler to not rebase.  I have messed up rebasing a few  times recently... =(

*   Continuum metadata request: can we add these to linter?

        *   example metadata: [](https://github.com/ContinuumIO/anaconda-recipes/blob/master/anaconda-build/meta.yaml#L36-L44)[https://github.com/ContinuumIO/anaconda-recipes/blob/master/anaconda-build/meta.yaml#L36-L44](https://github.com/ContinuumIO/anaconda-recipes/blob/master/anaconda-build/meta.yaml#L36-L44)
    *   Also, distinguish summary (limit of 77 or 80 chars) from description (unlimited)
    *   Anaconda  verify: would be nice to meet in the middle, rather than diverge.   conda-build may integrate anaconda-verify, would be nice if conda-forge  added metadata here.

*   Drop numpy 1.10 and reduce our build matrix. (Numba now works with numpy 1.11.)
*   Signing packages

        *   Should be easy to do. ( [](http://conda.pydata.org/docs/signed-packages.html)[http://conda.pydata.org/docs/signed-packages.html](http://conda.pydata.org/docs/signed-packages.html) )
    *   There has been some interest previously.

*   HTTPError: 503 Server Error: Service Unavailable: Back-end server is at capacity for url...

        *   Seems we are regularly running into this issue under normal usage conditions.
    *   Had discussed previously caching packages on AppVeyor and trying to reuse those to start.
    *   Maybe we need to consider caching on all CIs.
    *   Building our own Miniconda-like self-extracting scripts with packages via [`constructor`](https://github.com/conda/constructor).
    *   There  have been improvements on Continuum's side that should help this.  In  short, repodata (the package index for a given channel) was being  generated for each anaconda.org query.  This was unnecessarily high  cost, and some caching schemes have been implemented.

*   Handling removal of unpinned/improperly pinned packages.

        *   Has been done manually thus far.
    *   This doesn't scale well though.
    *   Should we (semi) automate removal?
    *   Should we hot-fix broken packages? ( [conda forge/conda forge.github.io#170](https://github.com/conda-forge/conda-forge.github.io/pull/170) )
    *   Should we label them as broken

*   Not currently buildable packages

        *   In particular open source code that is out of scope for CIs.
    *   Examples include Qt4, Qt5, possibly PyQt4, possibly PyQt5, gcc, VTK, etc. 

    *   How do we indicate they are built manually?
    *   Are we ok with uploading non-built binaries?
    *   When do we determine something is ok to be built manually?
    *   What procedures should people follow for building manually?

                *   Use a standard build docker image, VM, or vagrant file
        *   Sign package?
        *   Implement reproducible builds where feasible (linux)

                        *   [](https://reproducible-builds.org/)[https://reproducible-builds.org/](https://reproducible-builds.org/)

        *   What changes do we need to make in conda-smithy elsewhere?
    *   What other build infrastructure could we utilize?

                *   Would  be nice to provide some volunteer builder abstraction, so that we could  have an elastic worker farm that would be somewhat resilient.
        *   Standardizing build images is probably (relatively) easy - how to orchestrate, though?

*   [Staged Releases](https://conda-forge.hackpad.com/DZNKZdgiMbF)
*   Windows BLAS Solutions

        *   Still don't have a BLAS for Windows yet need something.
    *   Don't build a BLAS

                *   NumPy has a small subset of BLAS functionality.
        *   Not sure what to do with SciPy (unable to find Windows wheels for them either).

        *   Build OpenBLAS with C support only.

                *   Will be pretty slow.
        *   Should work on all Pythons.

        *   Build OpenBLAS with MinGW compilers.

                *   Works with Python 2.7 and 3.4.
        *   Won't work with Python 3.5?

        *   Reuse something like R's BLAS.

                *   Is there a package for something like this?
        *   Will it have the same issues with Python 3.5?

        *   ATLAS?
