**New items**

- We need to share two passwords: 
    - Just move the passwords to keybase
    [x] @Eric D uploaded the Twitter conda forge PW to keybase 2019-06-12
    [ ] Upload stages recipes GH acct pw to keybase
- 2fa for bots
    - How do we share creds for these?  Photos of the QR code in keybase? (Or share the passcode that the QR code represents)
- NumFOCUS summit will be in late Oct/early Nov it would be nice to have a strong conda-forge representation there.
- We have 1 small grant development from NumFOCUS (3k) with the goal of a SciPy sprint. I’m writing a new one (this round is 5k) for a better recipe regeneration in conda-skeleton. If anyone is interested please let me know. (I’ll share a Google docs soon.)
    - Is this specific to the pypi generation? Yes!
    - This might be a helpful starting point https://github.com/ericdill/conda-skeletor (This is a real dumb name, so please don’t keep the legacy of this name haha)
- We have a NumFOCUS team Google drive folder for conda-forge. Who has access to it? Should we make it available to all conda-forge core members?
    - Scopatz to check during the call
- SciPy 2019
    - BoF and Sprint submitted! We need to know who wants to go, present, use FA, etc.
    - Coordinate more SciPy activities: lightning talks, lunch/dinner?
    - ~~TODO: Open an issue on github conda-forge.github.io to keep track of who is going to Scipy 2019~~
    - https://github.com/conda-forge/conda-forge.github.io/issues/791
- Discuss a strategy to manage qt patches (23!) and new version builds in the CIs.
    - Should be able to drop some of the patches and simplify when python 2.7 deprecates. QT 5.9 is the last version for py27 b/c QT is not supporting vs 2008 after the 5.9 rev. 
- ESIP update:
    - balance: 3827.78 USD
    - use part of the money to pay for Azure dedicated machines: Windows and Linux to build Qt.
    - Use money to fund travel to SciPy this year?
- Long running build setup on linux
    - Set up build nodes on linux on azure.
    - Autoscaling group: then we don't have to pre-determine the instance sizing. 
    - TODO: Ask azure maybe?
- Nvidia money has not arrived for may profit / loss conda-forge report. Eric will ping Lynn and ask about these phantom dollars. 
- http://conda-forge.org does not auto-upgrade to https. This is a Marius thing.
- CFEP9 conda-smithy
    - PR is now doing the right thing but requires some minor changes to conda-build to make it less gross
    - Works for VC14→ 14.1 and VS2015→ VS2017 as a test case.  
    - How does staged-recipes need to be changed to account for these new migrators / pinnings
- Emiritus Change model
    - TODO: Governance model similar to sklearn for moving users to non-voting
    - https://github.com/conda-forge/conda-forge.github.io/pull/795
- Handling rc label with strict channel priority
    - https://github.com/conda/conda/issues/8752
    - https://github.com/conda-forge/conda-forge-enhancement-proposals/pull/3

**Old items**

- “Dogfood”  `strict`, which may be default in the next conda, in our CIs?
    - https://github.com/conda-forge/conda-forge-ci-setup-feedstock/pull/50
    - https://github.com/conda-forge/staged-recipes/pull/8009
    - Currently we have a problem with `vc` on Windows. If we activate `strict` only the `vc` present in conda-forge, which is vc 14, will be used but we are building without `strict` and depending on `vc 14.1` from `defaults`. That means we would need to remove conda-forge `vc` packages and probably do some rebuilds. (Tried to rebuild `qt` with strict and hit a wall there even when removing our `vc`, which means more things must be rebuild first, maybe a migrator would be the best course of action here.)
- Discuss the use of Drone (native ARM) in conda-forge.
    - https://github.com/conda-forge/conda-smithy/pull/1069
