**Attendees**
Jonathan Helmus, Eric Dill,  Filipe, @Michael Sarahan, Ray Donnelly
 
**Notes**

* [ ] Move to conda 4.3
* [ ] Dropbox paper: Create conda-forge account and share the credentials amongst core devs. Will need an email account to register on dropbox, so someone would need to create a shared email account too (strawman: conda-forge@gmail.com). cc @John Kirkham
* [ ] The token used to generate repos at staged-recipes got revoked by GitHub. @John Kirkham is working to fix that by using a token from a bot [John] has access to. Hoping we will be back up and running with a workaround. Complete fix will require Phil's help once he is able.
* [ ] Where is conda-forge on using better compilers? libgomp, etc.
* [ ] How much overlap is there between conda-build 3 and conda-build-all?
* [ ] Any plans for conda-build to build packages in parallel implicitly? Mike says no.
* [ ] should we pin toolchain to some version number?
* [ ] No changes to toolchain for now until conda-build 3 and then Mike and Ray's new compilers
