**Attendees**

*   Filipe
*   Mike
*   Phil

**Standing Items**

*   How many repos? ~1400
*   How many contributors? ~300
*   CFEP status

**Notes**

*   Action: Phil to take a look at [conda forge/conda forge.github.io#256](https://github.com/conda-forge/conda-forge.github.io/pull/256)
*   Filipe will ask Carlos whether he is prepared to build qt 
*   Binary data (repacking)

        *   Currently done with "low hanging fruit" or difficult packages
    *   CFEP would be helpful to give clear guidance
    *   What does it take to merge repackaging stuff?  At what point does it become painful enough to allow repackaging?  
    *   MSYS2 - [Michael Sarahan](https://conda-forge.hackpad.com/ep/profile/yHQTJXZ4gyS) to ask Ray about build infrastructure for MSYS2 and perhaps unification with conda/conda-forge
    *   Git  for windows as example to avoid (Large agglomeration of individual  projects - prefer to build individual projects).  If MSYS2 were not  available, this would be an OK candidate for repackaging, because it is  such a huge pain.  Because MSYS2 is available, we should avoid  repackaging git for windows.

*   conda-build 2

        *   bldpkg_path also takes a config argument. See [](https://circleci.com/gh/conda-forge/texinfo-feedstock/24)[https://circleci.com/gh/conda-forge/texinfo-feedstock/24](https://circleci.com/gh/conda-forge/texinfo-feedstock/24)

    *   There is very little that needs to be done. See [conda forge/conda forge build setup feedstock#38](https://github.com/conda-forge/conda-forge-build-setup-feedstock/issues/38)#issuecomment-262931757
    *   (It is a matter of merging PRs now :-) 

    *   can we just disable symlinks for environments when building to fix the CMAKE issue? Phil: I believe so. MS +1

                *   [](http://conda.pydata.org/docs/config.html#disallow-soft-linking-allow-softlinks)[http://conda.pydata.org/docs/config.html#disallow-soft-linking-allow-softlinks](http://conda.pydata.org/docs/config.html#disallow-soft-linking-allow-softlinks)

        *   ACTION: Let's get rid of softlinks when using conda-build

*   Handling broken packages

        *   Hotfix  capability: we will never have control of the channel index, so we must  rebuild or modify existing packages. MS: There should be a preference  for rebuild vs modify. CFEP (policy) would be helpful.
    *   Generally,  moving broken packages to a "broken" channel is preferable to deleting  them. We can consider purging these after a period of time.

**Agenda**

*   <s>Binary data in recipes </s>Repackaging existing executables
*   conda-forge installer (our own Miniconda)
