# 2018-03-06 meeting agenda

- Drop win32
    - Drop and see if users complain? (my bad idea!)
    - We do not know who the windows users are.
    - Open issue, tweet, mailing list, gitter to gauge interest 
    - Link to a google form: https://goo.gl/forms/F2PqL9WP9E609TEF2
    - Link to edit the form (DO NOT SHARE THIS ONE!!): https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1DbPWfHw1AhYWNsfsYzEo1AxZzKOpxoc-b7zaqY_AMls/edit?usp=sharing
- Build python 3.7 rc
    - Jonathan will start building rc in May when rc1 is scheduled
- Status of the conda-build 3 move
    - rebuild all packages that are pinned with conda-build 3 with run_exports ~30-40 packages, then release new version of conda-smithy 3.0.0 (release new packages to rc tag)
    - Move to conda build 3, then move to compilers
    - Listing of packages to rebuild in issue ( https://github.com/conda-forge/conda-forge-pinning-feedstock/issues/27 ).
- How to reduce binary size (strip our binaries?)
    - stripping binary can reduce size, has not be investigated much
    - switching to conda provided compilers will reduce binary sizes, devtoolset partially statically links libstdc++, libgcc 
    - Issue discussing stripping binaries ( https://github.com/conda-forge/conda-forge.github.io/issues/520 )
- AnacondaCon agenda
    - Eric (maybe), John, Filipe, Anthony, [Jonathan, Michael], CJ (maybe)
    - Have we heard anything from Peter? (esp. funding)
    - [+AnacondaCon agenda](https://paper.dropbox.com/doc/AnacondaCon-agenda-uBSJ4E3ZOVWMkej0w6zfe) 
- Use zoom for meetings?
    - Zoom can handle more people than Hangouts
    - Zoom needs native client, does include linux
    - Try Zoom next week, see which is better
    - join the “ericdill” meeting
