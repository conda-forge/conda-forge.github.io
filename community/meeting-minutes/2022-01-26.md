## Agenda

### Standing items

* [x] intros for new folks on the call

* [x] (FF) budget
    * current approvals?
    * Whenever updated numbers land, please screenshare and show the budget.
        * Link is in Keybase (numfocus_spreadsheets.txt)

* [x] open votes
    * 1 for core, 4 for staged recipes - expect 5 emails from voting system

* [x] 2022 Outreachy / GSoC 
    * Ask each week: Any interested parties in owning this?
        * News after discussing things at Anaconda
    * Discussion 2021-11-03
        * If we want to do outreachy again we need a champion - Filipe can't do it next year. Same with GSoC.
        * GSoC is free to us
        * Outreachy costs us $$ ($6500). $6k for student, $500 for admin
        * Some interest from Jannis - he and Filipe will chat about possibly handing off
            * Trying to figure out what policy for interns at Anaconda - some overlap maybe. 
              Jannis wants to pick Filipe's brain. Dave C. has also done this in the past at galaxy
      * (FF 2022-01-14) Folks. NumFOCUS is applying as an umbrella org for GSoC again. I won't be able to manage that again b/c I'll be doing that for my day job. If anyone is interested please reach out and I help you apply with NumFOCUS.
      * Anaconda is interested in funding outreachy ($6500-$7k) and helping with program managment (from new Berlin based staff)
      * Ideas
          * JK: docs could be a good idea for interns. Things where people dont need a whole lot of technical knowledge would be great.
          * https://github.com/marcelotrevisani/souschef
          * Grayskull
      * FF: Started with docs last time. this is more on our side. We're going to try next round. Was hoping to get someone to work on Grayskull, but Marcelo just had a kid so...
          * JR: Quansight has a summer internship program that could help out with some conda-forge stuff. Not going to do outreachy
      * DC: Current outreachy program is june-aug. need to submit community application (conda-forge is already approved) by a 25th of feb (but cf might not need to submit). project proposals will be due shortly after that. Something worth throwing out there, given outreachy's 
      * DC: Any bandwidth in bioconda to support outreachy?
      * MRB: If I can get help reviewing applications, I can handle most of the mentoring
          * Jaime, Filipe, Jannis volunteered to help reviewing applications
      * Jannis can mentor a more technical intern (maybe doing grayskull)
