    91 responses, 5 are using Win32, only 1 is using Win32 exclusively.
    - nsis only works on 32-bit — it is used by constructor on windows so it’s a critical package to keep working
    - Filipe will craft an email to let the community know.
- pypi/anaconda.org/wheel/conda-package
    - Collaboration (or at least communication) with the pypi/warehouse devs
    - Optionally building wheels for some packages. ( https://github.com/conda-forge/conda-smithy/issues/608 )
    - TODO: Chat at anacondacon about this
- How do we want the bot to handle non-release releases (alpha/beta/dev/pre/etc.) https://github.com/regro/cf-scripts/issues/86 and https://github.com/conda-forge/conda-forge-enhancement-proposals/pull/3 and https://github.com/conda-forge/matplotlib-feedstock/pull/24#issuecomment-221496870
    - conda-forge-pre?
    - TODO:
        - We will blacklist all “non-release” releases and not support automated releases from these tags. Do not support rc releases for now.
        - Better maintainer training (branching structure, etc.)
- John suggested (on gitter) that we reach out to intel and NVIDIA to get copies of their toolchains and development libraries.
    - We’ll cross this bridge when we have interest/time
    - GPU discussion - https://github.com/conda-forge/conda-forge.github.io/issues/63
