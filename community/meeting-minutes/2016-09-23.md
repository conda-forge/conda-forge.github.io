**Attendees**

*   Jonathan, Phil, John, Filipe,  Eric, Sylvain
*   **Apologies**
*   Michael (re 16th): wife's water broke. Probably not going to make this one. 

**Standing Items**

*   How many repos? ~1200
*   How many contributors? ~230

**Notes**

*   Recipe license to include in feedstock?

        *   Where to include?  In recipe? Should not be license for the package but rather for the **recipe.**
    *   Not many
    *   Deal with on-case-by case basis as extra commit on feedstock.

*   Moving to conda build 2.0 requires rebuilding ~35 packages.

        *   Rebuilding should be done before moving all feedstocks to new version
    *   Not backwards incompatible.  Mixing short and long prefix will results in short prefixes.
    *   Filipe has done this with his own build system, maybe some issues on Windows.

    *   This is the issue our Windows tech is seeing [conda/conda build#1383](https://github.com/conda/conda-build/pull/1383)

    *   Conclusion: start rebuilding packages that use short binary prefix, then flip switch on all recipes.

*   Phil will be in Oz for next 6 months (Melbourne: UTC +10)
*   Next meeting schedule with doodle
*   Sylvain -- mixing VC runtimes

        *   Recommend that these be placed in a different channel
    *   Python 2.7 with VC 14/2015 should be considered a new version.
    *   Proposal is to build extensions with VC 14 not Python itself
    *   [conda forge/feather format feedstock#7](https://github.com/conda-forge/feather-format-feedstock/pull/7)
    *   [conda forge/feather format feedstock#6](https://github.com/conda-forge/feather-format-feedstock/pull/6)
    *   CFEP -- with types of errors we can see

*   conda-smithy release -- Maybe Monday?
*   Do not know why rerendering is happening slowly

        *   Rerendering happens on Heroku, max 5 PR but can up limit

*   CFEP -- if you have not looked at them CFEP 01 do so soon:

        *   [conda forge/conda forge enhancement proposals#1](https://github.com/conda-forge/conda-forge-enhancement-proposals/pull/1)
    *   Can CFEPs change after the fact
    *   What is consensus?  BDFL, vote, vetos (like NumPy?), other?

                *   majority of  core member -- at meetings

        *   Formal Government document, which includes how consensus is reached. -- or should this be seperate
    *   Start repo with 

*   Have a look at 

        *   [conda forge/conda forge enhancement proposals#3](https://github.com/conda-forge/conda-forge-enhancement-proposals/pull/3)
    *   Labels for Python 3.6 -- Jonathan will add comment
    *   Offer ability to build against Python 3.6?
