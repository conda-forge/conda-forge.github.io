## Agenda

### Your agenda items

* [x] (CJ) budget, also finance subteam creation
  * https://github.com/conda-forge/conda-forge.github.io/pull/1093
* [x] intros for new folks on the call
* [x] (FF) Open Force Field request to NumFOCUS
    * Likely looking to engage in a contract relationship, Anthony interested
    * We could create a list of "suggested" companies/persons who do this type of work
    * Where should we land this information on the website?
        * conda-forge.org/commercial
        * conda-forge.org/
* [x] (FF) Should we do Outreachy as part of an effort to support diversity in tech? Advantages are low cost
      and high impact. Disadvantages are the time effort from the mentors.

* [x] (ED) Did we need to document anything from the CUDA 11 stuff that Keith brought up last time? No.
    * [x] (KK) CUDA 11 support
        - CUDA 11 dropped CentOS 6 support
        - ties into CentOS 7 migration above
        - `cudatoolkit` 11 - https://github.com/AnacondaRecipes/cudatoolkit-feedstock/pull/7
            - Make sure we have a glibc run constrain line
        TODO: Jonathan will review this PR
        - Add Docker image (need to double check how `FROM` can be adjusted conditionally)
            - Needs a recent docker version but this should work
              ```
              ARG IMAGE=ubuntu:latest
              FROM ${IMAGE}
              ```

* [x] (KK) CUDA Toolkit in conda-forge update
    * With a few changes to the recipe conda-forge will be able to build+distribute cudatoolkit
    * TODO: Eric will get the NVBug link from Keith and archive it in the conda-forge google drive.
    * TODO: John K. will update the cuda toolkit feedstock on the git repo to note the NVBug link to the internal NVIDIA issue tracker
    * TODO: Jonathan will update docs to note that some non-exhaustive list of packages (like cuda-toolkit, MKL, etc.)

* [x] (IF) strict channel priority
    - Needed for PyPy
    - Needed for Cos7
    - Remove packages that we don't fully support. For eg: there are 3 builds of scipy on windows.
    - Older versions of tensorflow?
    - Could make strict a option in conda_forge.yaml

* [x] Discussion of "hard to build packages"
    * rstudio (redist may be somewhat sketchy?)
    * tensorflow
    * qt
    * scipy on Windows
    * Should we publish a list and ask for help on those?

* [x] (UK) CFEP-18, please vote
    - https://github.com/conda-forge/cfep/pull/34
    - voting passed!

* [x] (UK) Voting Fatigue
    - discussed various alternatives
    - sub-teams

* [ ] (UK) "GPL-free" variants
    - Some packages like Python, sqlite have a dependency on libreadline which is GPL licensed.
      There might be arguments that this doesn't trickle up the stack but Corporate Compliance/IT have a different stance on that.
    - Similar issues with other packages where the GPL-dependency is quite often an optional one.
    - We probably want to have that functionality enabled by default but provide an alternative variant without GPL dependencies.

* [ ] (CL) msys2 packages
    - Anaconda deciding on update plans for "defaults" channel
