### Your `__new__()` agenda items

- [x] (HV) Drop CUDA 11.8: https://github.com/conda-forge/conda-forge-pinning-feedstock/issues/7404
  - this is currently blocking the CUDA 12.(8,9) [migration](https://github.com/conda-forge/conda-forge-pinning-feedstock/pull/7005), which we need for supporting newer architectures like sm_120.
  - Also is getting more painful to maintain (more complex to maintain than other CUDA versions)
  - Seeing fewer user downloads
  - (DJC) Dropping CUDA Toolkit (CTK) 11.8 support from conda-forge is fine by NVIDIA; we'll support CTK 11.8 in our products' feedstocks if we decide we need to extend support
  - Overall consensus to do this, make announcement and execute in 1-2 weeks.
  - (JRG) When doing CUDA Docker images get dropped?
  - (JK) Support is based on associated driver version support
    - https://gitlab.com/nvidia/container-images/cuda/-/issues/177
- [x] (HV) Compiler upgrades: GCC 14 & Clang 19: https://github.com/conda-forge/conda-forge-pinning-feedstock/pull/7421
  - Make announcement once remaining PRs are in and tested 
- [x] (HV) Move to VS2022: https://github.com/conda-forge/conda-forge.github.io/issues/2138
  - (DJC) We should just try it in some CUDA feedstocks if we're concerned about compatability
      - (DJC) CUDA 11.8 only works with a earlier VS2022 version. It is not compatible with the latest VS2022. For CUDA 12.4+, this is not an issue.  Details in https://github.com/conda-forge/conda-forge.github.io/issues/2138#issuecomment-2913390542 and following.
      - (HV) Given we are ok dropping CUDA 11.8, we should be ok.
  - (IF) Azure/GitHub Actions still have VS2019, but it is in a different location.
  - Plan is to move forward with VS2022.
  - (HV) Make announcement once ready
- [x] (HV) Dealing with C++/Fortran modules (https://github.com/conda-forge/conda-forge.github.io/issues/2525) -- we probably need to implement `host_exports` (https://github.com/conda/ceps/issues/77)
  - Not a theoretical concern; we're hitting this on some Fortran feedstocks: https://github.com/conda-forge/flang-activation-feedstock/issues/14
  - Planning to follow up on issue
- [x] (HV) Follow through on numpy 2 migration closure: https://github.com/conda-forge/conda-forge.github.io/pull/2522
    - (JK) Bulk of libraries support NumPy 2
        - https://github.com/numpy/numpy/issues/26191
- [x] (HV) Pytorch 2.7 [migration](https://github.com/conda-forge/conda-forge-pinning-feedstock/pull/7348) blocked since ~one month due to -- is there a way to debug/fix this, or do we want to migrate without windows?
    - (IF) Is the package on cf-staging that we can copy over?
        - (HV) Need to check whether this could be an option
    - (IF) Other option would be caching on CI and copying over
        - (HV) Think this doesn't work with the GPU builds
        - (JRG) Checking with Amit just to make sure
- [x] (DJC) Tegra CUDA Toolkit Migration announcement https://github.com/conda-forge/cuda-feedstock/issues/57
    - (IF) Can we figure out a way of building for SBSA & Tegra in the same build?
        - (DJC) Would be unsupported
            - (IF) We do other custom things to make life easier on our maintainers. Think this would still be valuable
            - (IF) This would also avoid the need for a migrator.
            - (DJC) Would like to do some simple tests to see how packages behave
- [x] (JRG) Core activity check in https://github.com/conda-forge/governance/issues/1
- [x] (JRG) CPython supported releases policy discussion at https://github.com/conda-forge/python-feedstock/issues/794 (prompted by 3.14 rcs coming soon)
    - (JRG) Please comment here
    - (IF) Is this the right place to discuss the matrix?
        - (HV) Useful for discoverability
        - (JK) Important to note we will keep the python package updated to continue to support the matrix.
