## Agenda

### Standing items

* [ ] intros for new folks on the call
    * [ ] Filipe Lains
    
* [ ] (CJ) budget
    * current approvals?
    * Whenever updated numbers land, please screenshare and show the budget.
        * Link is in Keybase (numfocus_spreadsheets.txt)

* [ ] open votes
    * none


### From previous meeting(s)
* [x] (CB) Now have a 1password account
    * Chris Burr will send invite link around to core. Existing owner needs to approve
    * Can store secrets in there. 
        * Should move all 2FA in authy to keybase so we dont need to harass Isuru for his phone number
    * Migrate everything to 1password. Can still chat on Keybase.
* [x] (CJ) conda-forge patches for conda backwards compat (`=` is done, but what about `~=` and others)
    * (IF) we should not break deps of conda so people can update their envs
    * todo
        * [x] bump this at the community meeting
        * [x] (MRB) Cheng, did we patch conda build/index to not put the newer ops in generated repodata?
            - conda-index not currently patched
            - Anaconda will work on this issue (assuming no one else does)

### Your __new__() agenda items

* [x] (MRB) intel compiler agreement
    * see core email list for text
    * unclear if the agreement would impact current MKL builds if it was terminated
    * TODO: Wait for numfocus and then ship it :ship: 
        * [x] (MRB) post note on core gitter about it
* [X] (MRB) update on travis stuff
    * [ ] TODO: Write blog post for transparency reasons. Need a champion for this one (Matt can at end of october)
* [X] (JK) CUDA 11.3 & 11.4 (dropping 10.x)
    * Wanted to drop old compilers (gcc8?) and use new compilers (gcc9). Can't figure out a way to get the migrations to work. Ideally want to move to enhanced compatibility. Want to set up new CUDA packages too. Makes sense to make these two big changes together instead of two big changes separately. 
    * Repodata hotfix that does `==11.2` to `>=11.2,<12`
        * (KK) May need to check if there's constraints on `__cuda` in the `cudatoolkit` package that would also need to be patched?
    * Also ok to add `cudatoolkit` packages for 11.3 & 11.4
* [X] (JK) CUDA ARM
* [x] (JK) Drone
* [x] (CB) OpenSSL 3.0.0 migration? https://github.com/conda-forge/conda-forge-pinning-feedstock/pull/1896

### Pushed to next meeting

* [ ] (CHL) Python 3.10
    * RCs should be compatible with final release
    * Need new conda-build release to build
* [ ] (CJ via MRB) more reproducible builds?
    * CJ: thinks its pretty close
    * motivated by this blog post: https://hpc.guix.info/blog/2021/09/whats-in-a-package/
    * embed azure build log into the package
    * embed which build system
    * git hash of feedstock?
    * turn off force push to feedstocks
    * need a way to force the build/host/test envs to be the same
    * (IF): see https://github.com/conda/conda-build/issues/2140

### Active votes

### CFEPs

* [cfep-12](https://github.com/conda-forge/cfep/pull/23) Removing packages that violate the terms of the source package
