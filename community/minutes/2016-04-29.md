Agenda:

*   Dependency tracking (I know this has jumped the order, but this has become extremely pressing.)

        *   Proposed fixes to conda-build. There are many and this is pretty slow moving.

                *   Question about conda-smithy/conda-build-all requirements. Please see reference to "Question 4.5" in [this comment](https://github.com/conda/conda-build/pull/848#issuecomment-215523101) 

        *   Internal pinning mechanism. [Phil Elson](https://conda-forge.hackpad.com/ep/profile/AviM60TiesB) wrote some nice scripts here and they are very helpful.
    *   Questions:

                *   How can we figure out what things need pinning?
        *   When do we rollback a pinning?
        *   How can we handle pinning in a more automated manner?

                        *   What things should be pinned?
            *   How to handle version updates?
            *   How to identify problem areas (packages that can't accept a pin)?

*   PyPI metadata redundancy

        *   Prototype tool to convert pure Python wheels directly to conda packages: [](https://github.com/takluyver/wheel2conda)https://github.com/takluyver/wheel2conda
    *   Automated feedstock maintenance.

*   Python3 vs Python==3

        *   How to depend (inc build depend) on applications which require Python 3, from a Python==2 env
    *   'Subenvironment dependencies' are a possible alternative

*   Complex licenses (e.g. MKL, CUDA, cuDNN, etc.)
*   Packaging python itself
*   VC features (what more needs discussing for the general meeting?)
*   yum requirements (partially resolved)
*   Low level packaging
*   NetCDF (also curl/ca-certificates and Perl packages)
*   Adding a devtoolset to the container (for now).
*   Movement of Docker images to common spaces (Docker Hub org, GitHub org).
*   MSYS2 integrated into conda. How do we want to use this? Do we still want VC?
*   GitHub rate limitations. How can we further mitigate these?
*   Add namespace to packages `node-`, `ruby-`, `perl-`, `why not python-` ;-)

*   Dropping py34 [conda forge/staged recipes#465](https://github.com/conda-forge/staged-recipes/pull/465)

Notes:

*   Let's give webex a shot
*   Dependency tracking

        *   Currently baking in versions into the recipe, automated with script from [Phil Elson](https://conda-forge.hackpad.com/ep/profile/AviM60TiesB)
    *   Version choices are decided manually at the moment
    *   [](https://github.com/conda-forge/staged-recipes/wiki/Pinned-dependencies)https://github.com/conda-forge/staged-recipes/wiki/Pinned-dependencies
    *   What if we want to change a pinned version, say zlib 1.2 to 1.3?
    *   Shared VM which performs automated and semi-automated tasks which multiple contributors have access too

                *   Look into setting up a lightweight host/VM, heroku

        *   How to decide when to update pinned dependecy

*   Proposed fixes to conda-build, [conda/conda build#848](https://github.com/conda/conda-build/pull/848)

        *   Will these brake conda-build-all, do we care?
    *   Micheal is working on conda-render tool to try to fill in as much jinja template as possible
    *   Talk about this specific topic, plan agenda in advance

                *   Plan time using emai/GitHub

        *   Sticking point are build matrix and validiatable

*   Complex licensing, ie MKL, CUDA, CuDNN

        *   MKL runtimes are spelled out, headers more complex
    *   CUDA seems better, CentOS 6 images available
    *   Micheal not aware of CuDNN requirements

                *   Micheal will look into cuDNN license constraints.

*   Python package

        *   Windows needs some files moved.
    *   Features or vc package?
    *   xz 5.0 or 5.2?  Start with 5.0, then do 5.2 build
    *   Branding?  

                *   Easy to implement, but is it wanted?
        *   Not major concern for Continuum
        *   Helpful when resolving problems, detecting when system Python
        *   Put it in, not too hard and will help downstream organizations

All of the contents below were discussed between [Phil Elson](https://conda-forge.hackpad.com/ep/profile/AviM60TiesB) and [John Kirkham](https://conda-forge.hackpad.com/ep/profile/wv6uvIZX6h0). Many of the items have already been planned before and just need the details ironed out. Anything that required large group discussion was not decided in anyway.

*   Yum requirements

        *   Decided to go with this PR ( [conda forge/conda smithy#135](https://github.com/conda-forge/conda-smithy/pull/135) ).
    *   Current use case is still VTK and freeglut (forgot to mention this). Though VTK is proceeding through a new PR ( [conda forge/staged recipes#453](https://github.com/conda-forge/staged-recipes/pull/453) ). freeglut is still in this PR ( [conda forge/staged recipes#373](https://github.com/conda-forge/staged-recipes/pull/373) ).

*   Low level packaging

        *   Some brief discussion about using different subchannels for these to avoid dependency clashes (e.g. compiler components).
    *   There are some gray areas that will eventually be encountered, but no examples were fleshed out. Though a few might be `gmp` and `mpfr` as they are both compiler dependencies and used by other packages like symbolic math packages (e.g. SymPy).

*   Adding a devtoolset to the container (for now).

        *   This was already merged (adds devtoolset-2).
    *   [Phil](https://conda-forge.hackpad.com/ep/profile/AviM60TiesB) has rebuilt this.
    *   [John](https://conda-forge.hackpad.com/ep/profile/wv6uvIZX6h0) tested the image with a trivial C++11 [program](https://github.com/jakirkham/hello_tests/blob/5b2f6b0c5682ecd84bee3be9cb73d790265f6002/hello.cxx) and that worked fine.
    *   Automatic builds are not working. Will likely contact Docker to fix. However, this only matters if this problem still happens after moving the images.

*   Movement of Docker images to common spaces (Docker Hub org, GitHub org).

        *   [John](https://conda-forge.hackpad.com/ep/profile/wv6uvIZX6h0) will add the PRs to move Obvious-CI's Docker image to the org and from Obvious-CI.
    *   Docker Hub org is already setup
    *   Repo on GitHub is ready to go.
    *   Need to setup autobuilds for the image(s).
    *   Also, need to switch everything to using the Docker image from the org repo.
