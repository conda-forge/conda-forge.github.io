### Your `__new__()` agenda items

- [x] (HV) 10th anniversary [coming up](https://conda-forge.zulipchat.com/#narrow/channel/457339-core/topic/10th.20anniversary) on April 11th -- let's celebrate that visibly (even if it's only a blog post).
  - Jaime will draft something 
- [x] (HV) Closing the Numpy 2.0 migration? https://github.com/conda-forge/conda-forge-pinning-feedstock/issues/7222
    - If we do close it, post an announcement.
    - MRB: ~30 unsent PRs because they are awaiting parents. We could force-send them so at least they have a notice about the situation. This probably needs a little PR in the bots to by pass the 'awaiting-parents' checks.
- [x] (HV) BLAS situation: MKL 2025 has [broken](https://github.com/conda-forge/intel_repack-feedstock/issues/83) something in the way it does its "single dynamic library", which we're using to make the blas-metapackage work. Tried patching things, but not successful. This is pretty painful because it pushes the solver into weird places and should be fixed ASAP IMO. Help most welcome.
    - (DJC) Will try to reach out to Intel folks directly through professional network
- [x] (HV) How to deal with macOS lower bound going forward: https://github.com/conda-forge/conda-forge.github.io/issues/2467
    - Favor changes in pinnings and smithy
    - DJC: Why not follow Apple's policies?
        - IF: Too aggressive; we would need to update very often and leave a lot of packages behind. Even Homebrew stays a bit behind on purpose.
        - DJC: We should have both a lower bound policy (e.g. 7 years old version) and a mechanism for migrating dependency trees for groups of packages which need a newer development toolchain
        - IF: That might be controversial given the multiple stakeholders in conda-forge. Agree it's necessary but expect long discussions.
- [x] (ME) Introducing a [composite action](https://github.com/marcoesters/installer/blob/init-action/action.yaml) to create `constructor`-based installers (Miniconda, Miniforge)
- [x] (JRG) Enforcing emeritus provisions
- [x] (IF) Duplicate RPATHs disallowed in macOS 15.4+. Need to teach conda to remove if existing
  - already showing up in numpy: https://github.com/conda-forge/numpy-feedstock/issues/347 
  - Action item: raise issue in conda-build
  - Thread at: https://conda-forge.zulipchat.com/#narrow/channel/457337-general/topic/Multiple.20LD_RPATH.20in.20libgfortran
- [x] (JRG) New features in [conda-metadata-app](https://conda-metadata-app.streamlit.app/):
    - [Linked dependency lists](https://conda-metadata-app.streamlit.app/?q=conda-forge%2Flinux-64%2Fpython-3.13.2-hf636f53_101_cp313.conda&richtable=true) (check option on the sidebar)
    - Report artifact size
    - Remember subdir choices while browsing
- [x] (HV) [stretch; sort after current affairs] Discussion about rebuilding the world https://github.com/conda-forge/conda-forge.github.io/issues/2295 (VS 18.0 has [appeared](https://github.com/microsoft/STL/wiki/Changelog#vs-180) on the horizon; might break ABI)
