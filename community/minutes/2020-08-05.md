## Agenda

### Standing items
* [x] intros for new folks on the call
* [x] (CJ) budget


### Your new agenda items

* [x] (MRB) going to start removing people from feedstocks
    * smithy and the web services have not been removing people from maintenance teams 
      when they are no longer listed in the recipe
    * I put in a bug fix for this
    * I tested the bug fix in various permutations using a test feedstock. Works fine.
    * going to roll it out
        * make an announcement
        * turn it on for the webservices
        * use an admin migration to clean up the rest of the feedstocks
    * No issues or concerns raised

* [x] (MRB) finally finish CFEP-13
    * the output validation appears to be working fine
        * (IF) we still have git clone issues from time to time, but not a huge issue
        * (MRB) The latest smithy fixes though so they should be less and less common as people 
          use the updated version.
    * last step is to rotate the binstar token
        * going to delete all current tokens for conda-forge and make a new one that
          just lives in heroku and admin-requests
    * roll out:
        * make an announcement
        * make a new token
        * update heroku with new token
        * update admin-requests with new token
        * hopefully we don't break anything
    * post roll out cleanup
        * remove any old encrypted tokens from conda-forge.yml in feedstocks
        * put staging token in the azure global cred we use
        * remove individual creds from azure builds
    * Consider dropping building python 3.6 with PGO (Windows builds on appveyor)

* [x] Dropping python 3.6
    * need an announcement cycle
    * should we follow NEP29? NEP29 + 6 months?
        * https://numpy.org/neps/nep-0029-deprecation_policy.html#drop-schedule
    * End of life for Python 3.x versions:
        * https://devguide.python.org/#status-of-python-branches
    * No pypy for 3.7
        * https://foss.heptapod.net/pypy/pypy/-/wikis/py3.7%20status
    * Action Item: Send to issue (get input from pypy team and others)

* [x] (CHL) Upcoming conda 4.8.4 release; planning for 4.9.0
    * 4.8.4 is (more or less) bug fix only, including two bugs that cause data loss.
        * Expected release date: 2020-08-07 (ish).
    * 4.9.0 in planning:
        * Should be relatively fast follow from 4.8.4 (1-2 months following)
        * Major changes: Isuru's CPU feature flags and osx-arm64 PRs (changes
          virtual package reporting; adds new un-tested, "un-released" platform
          so not appropriate for patch release)
    * (MRB) This one too please: https://github.com/conda/conda/pull/10057
        * looks like it is on 4.9.0

 * [x] (Paul Martin) Repacking intel MKL from intel instead of Anaconda
     * https://github.com/conda-forge/intel_repack-feedstock/pulls
     * https://github.com/conda-forge/intel_repack-feedstock/pull/12
     * Action Items:
         * Request input from Intel on their level of comforat among our options for repackaging
         * If they are comfortable with a direct repackage ask for permissions to scrape the version
           numbers as needed by the bot
         * If Intel is comfortable with bot scraping, put up issue to cf-scripts to enable
         * Check back in one month unless things happen sooner

* [cfep-10](https://github.com/conda-forge/conda-forge-enhancement-proposals/pull/15) Feedstock statuses, unmaintained
    * INACTIVE - Merge in with some inactive-esque status?
    * Needs another review. Has unaddressed updates from pkgw as of Jan 11, 2020

    * Active debate about moving to "broken" vs deleting from conda-forge channel
    * Active vote, ends on 2020-03-11

    * Stalled debate about implementation details between Isuru, CJ and Matt
    * **UPDATE 2020-07-22**: We in principle have agreement to render the extra pinnings needed directly in the feedstock 
      on a temporary basis (i.e., until the migration has ended).
