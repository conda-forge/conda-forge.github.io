### Your __new__() agenda items

- [ ] JRG: Merge conda and conda-forge calls? ([Zulip thread](https://conda.zulipchat.com/#narrow/channel/457607-general/topic/Europe.2FAfrica.2FAsia.20friendly.20time.20slot.20for.20community.20meetings/with/541745508))

- [ ] KZ: Unpause Python free-threaded migrator?
    - https://github.com/conda-forge/conda-forge-pinning-feedstock/pull/6673
    - https://github.com/conda-forge/conda-forge-pinning-feedstock/pull/7777
    - IF: Check if upstream has support for freethreaded Python by consulting if PyPI has ft wheels.
    - KZ: Seed initial allow-list with known well-supported projects. e.g. https://hugovk.github.io/free-threaded-wheels/
    - JRG: Start with an [arch-like migrator](https://github.com/regro/cf-scripts/blob/main/conda_forge_tick/migrators/arch.py)?
        - IF: A YAML migrator might suffice with an `allow-list` field
    - Conclusion: unpause once migrator is available.
