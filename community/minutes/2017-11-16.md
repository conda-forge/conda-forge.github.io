    - Prefixed compilers: require activation
    - Common adaptations required for new anaconda compilers:
- Mac: LLVM/clang 4.0.1
    - prefixed compilers: require activation
    - common adaptations required for new anaconda compilers:
- Windows: activation scripts
    - Need adaptation for Appveyor compiler locations
    - common adaptations required:
        - cmake 
            - clear CC and/or CXX vars



    import os

Overall: everyone receptive to new compilers.  Mike to provide way of keeping host and build prefix separate, even when not cross compiling.  This would avoid need for things like "always_include_files" and would facilitate conda-forge keeping their llvmdev recipe as is (for cling usage).  

Filipe: this is really little more than a vendor change.  We already depend on other vendors for compilers (RH for devtoolset2; apple for existing clang), we’re only switching to a different vendor, not fundamentally changing what we do.

Need to maintain llvm with cling patches, but this will not be the default compiler.

## Conda-build 3: strategy for moving
- install and use with c-b-a (no cb3 matrix)
    - Waiting on feedback from issue https://github.com/conda-tools/conda-build-all/issues/94 but mostly seems OK.
- Mike: needs to fix —skip-existing.  Concern is that re-rendering should not generate new packages when only some dependency has changed (bugfix bump?)
    - Jonathan to explore ways to skip uploads when only hash has changed as a temporary workaround.
- replace c-b-a with cb3 matrix support
    - replace pinning script with central conda_build_config.yaml
        - Re-render installs from conda-forge central config package, uses that config
        - Each recipe can have its own conda_build_config.yaml alongside its meta.yaml file to override anything
    - Where/how to store intermediate files and distribute CI jobs
        - John recommended committing these to the feedstock repo during re-rendering
        - Jonathan wondered about committing the full conda_build_config.yaml to the repo, or pulling it in as a dependency at build time, but then reducing it using environment variables.
        - Mike wondered about CONDA_VARIANT_* as a pattern for environment variables that CB might recognize, so that we keep the current CI scheme.  This probably also integrates with Jonathan’s idea of reducing the matrix on a per-job basis.  Conda-smithy would create the set of jobs, each with different env vars to reduce the overall matrix for each job.
- use run_exports and use either c-b-a or cb3
    - People generally interested, but needs to be implemented and proven over time.  Good experience so far with defaults.


## Fortran support on Windows
- gfortran (msys2) / Flang
- Timeline for adding either
- Mike asked that whatever is done is done with community approval, for the sake of maintaining a high quality user experience.


## OpenMP behavior
- Currently, needs extra package on mac, but is included on Linux (not active in flags, though)
- What is desirable default behavior?
