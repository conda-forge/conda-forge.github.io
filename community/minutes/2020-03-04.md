# 2020-03-04 conda-forge core meeting 


## Attendees

## Agenda

* (ericdill) cfep-12
    * Need more conversation about moving to broken vs deleting
    * what does the license ID field mean?
    * had a long discussion at numfocus summit. we decided to not consult a lawyer. If someone asks us to remove the package then we have to, but if they dont they we are good as we are. We _can_ consult a lawyer and figure out if this is ok
    * broken is not removal, but removing harms reproducibility
    * deleting the package is the safe approach without consulting a lawyer
    * 
* (ericdill) cfep-13
* (filipe) NumFOCUS point of contact person
    * Filipe to send out email/gitter to the conda-forge core team.

* (marcel) quorum / timeout thing for votes
