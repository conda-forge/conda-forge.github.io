## Agenda

### Standing items

* [x] intros for new folks on the call

* [x] (CJ) budget
    * current approvals?
    * Whenever updated numbers land, please screenshare and show the budget.
        * Link is in Keybase (numfocus_spreadsheets.txt)

* [x] (MRB/ED/SC) Roadmap / Funding
    * goal is to spend 15 minutes each core meeting for ~3-4 meetings to discuss this
        * Save last 15 minutes for this.
    * https://hackmd.io/0zGSUS71SbOdBsdLtDmGjg
    * notes will get added to hackmd above
    * MRB will collate into a document of sorts
    * Today I have two ideas for discussion
        * do some sizing and try and get a sense of how much each item might cost in terms of developer days and dollars
        * have a rambling discussion on where conda-forge is going and what we want to do in the next 5 years or so

#### From previous meeting(s)

* [x] (MRB / ED / SC) Roadmap / Funding? Discussion in gitter:
    * (SC) What would CF do as a project if it received funding? Maybe having some kind of whitepapers on the conda-forge website would help. Would conda-forge do something very different if some corporation gave 10k, 100k, or 1M to the project via NumFOCUS? 
        * 10k: does it buy enough hosting to do something interesting? 
        * 100k - what does it bring. 
        * A much larger amount: conda-forge may even be able to have funded people directly working on the project.
        * We can almost certainly find a lot useful stuff that would not hurt getting funding for without necessarily having to get consensus on a roadmap. (something i think would not be controversial, like oh we could use some funding to do some nice web development for better visualization of migrations, or stuff) there are probably a lor of things of that nature.
    * If we make a list, Santa may just show up...
    * see the bloomberg note above...
    * wishlist and ideas: https://hackmd.io/0zGSUS71SbOdBsdLtDmGjg
        * (ED) Can we add initials for whomever submitted the idea? would be useful to track that if there are follow-on questions
        * (MRB) Start chatting on this for 15 minutes in the next core meeting


### Your __new__() agenda items

* [x] (IF) Ask Anaconda Inc for more storage for cf-staging.
    * (CHL) Will raise with Anaconda IT this week :tada: (CAS: Updated the storage for cf-staging to 100GB 10/18: MRB: Thank you!)
    * TODO: Matt, can you write down that thing you just said about pushing commits to restart the builds?
        * yes!
    * (WV) Will be working with OVH to set up Quetz on their infra. Revisit after the new year. 
* [x] (MDT) Souschef - Marcelo
* [x] (FF) SciPy Windows build long and short term plans:
    * build with ifort, deal with channel priority churn when defaults has one;
    * Consider Intel oneAPI (still in beta, and need to check license): https://software.intel.com/content/www/us/en/develop/tools/oneapi/hpc-toolkit.html
        * TODO: Marius ping folks at intel about getting access to this for our CI. From Marius 2020-10-28: No legal problems with installing the oneapi stuff
    * build with msys2 (we'll need help from someone intimated with numpy.distutils);
    * wait until defaults have one and move the migration forward without SciPy on Windows. (May require some bot workarounds.)
    * py39 migration stuck because of scipy on windows.
    * for py38, Marius built the scipy windows one locally on windows machine, uploaded it, etc. Then we also replicated all of the latest versions of scipy from defaults into our channel to deal with channel priority. Can't quite remember all of the details. (IF) Marius built 3.8. Then copied the other python versions for the latest scipy version from defaults.
    * Given the Anaconda timeline of ~1 month we should just wait for anaconda to provide
* [x] (CHL) Pending compiler updates for defaults
    * Linux: GCC 9.x vs 10.x.
        * gfortran 8/9/10/11 should have the same ABI
        * 10.3 is what ppl are thinking about at anaconda
        * NVCC not comaptible with GCC 10; nvcc 10.0 -> GCC 7, nvcc 10.1,10.2 -> GCC 8; nvcc 11.0 -> GCC 9, nvcc 11.1 -> GCC 10
            * Support chart here: https://gist.github.com/ax3l/9489132
            * only applies to compiling code for the device (.cu files), can use CUDA libraries and host APIs without nvcc
    * Windows: VS 2015 or 2017
        * CF using 2017 for Python >=3.5.

    * INACTIVE - Merge in with some inactive-esque status?
