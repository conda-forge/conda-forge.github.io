        - https://github.com/conda-forge/AnacondaRecipesSync
        - CJ reports ~763 packages that use "toolchain" in build deps.  MichaelS to get that list from CJ, and will divide into two sets:
            - recipes that have already been done in AnacondaRecipes and should be PR’ed to Conda-forge
            - recipes that need modification for new compilers and remove python as mechanism for activating VC features
