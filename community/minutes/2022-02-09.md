## Agenda

### Standing items

* [ ] intros for new folks on the call

* [ ] (FF) budget
    * current approvals?
    * Whenever updated numbers land, please screenshare and show the budget.
        * Link is in Keybase (numfocus_spreadsheets.txt)

* [ ] open votes
    * 1 for core, 4 for staged recipes - expect 5 emails from voting system

* [ ] 2022 Outreachy / GSoC 
    * Ask each week: Any interested parties in owning this?
        * News after discussing things at Anaconda
    * Discussion 2021-11-03
        * If we want to do outreachy again we need a champion - Filipe can't do it next year. Same with GSoC.
        * GSoC is free to us
        * Outreachy costs us $$ ($6500). $6k for student, $500 for admin
        * Some interest from Jannis - he and Filipe will chat about possibly handing off
            * Trying to figure out what policy for interns at Anaconda - some overlap maybe. 
              Jannis wants to pick Filipe's brain. Dave C. has also done this in the past at galaxy
      * (FF 2022-01-14) Folks. NumFOCUS is applying as an umbrella org for GSoC again. I won't be able to manage that again b/c I'll be doing that for my day job. If anyone is interested please reach out and I help you apply with NumFOCUS.
      * Anaconda is interested in funding outreachy ($6500-$7k) and helping with program managment (from new Berlin based staff)
      * Ideas
          * JK: docs could be a good idea for interns. Things where people dont need a whole lot of technical knowledge would be great.
          * https://github.com/marcelotrevisani/souschef
          * Grayskull
      * FF: Started with docs last time. this is more on our side. We're going to try next round. Was hoping to get someone to work on Grayskull, but Marcelo just had a kid so...
          * JR: Quansight has a summer internship program that could help out with some conda-forge stuff. Not going to do outreachy
      * DC: Current outreachy program is june-aug. need to submit community application (conda-forge is already approved) by a 25th of feb (but cf might not need to submit). project proposals will be due shortly after that. Something worth throwing out there, given outreachy's 
      * DC: Any bandwidth in bioconda to support outreachy?
      * MRB: If I can get help reviewing applications, I can handle most of the mentoring
          * Jaime, Filipe, Jannis volunteered to help reviewing applications
      * Jannis can mentor a more technical intern (maybe doing grayskull)

### From previous meeting(s)

### Your __new__() agenda items

* [x] (CHL) .conda-format support being added to anaconda.org
    * Currently, format conversion must be done by builder
    * Will need help testing uploading, web pages, CDN sync
* [x] (WV) new `build.py` cross-platform build script format (https://github.com/wolfv/bitfurnace) (modeled )
* [x] (IF) cirun for conda-forge/core only
* [x] Matthias - expert advice on trademark stuff. he handled trademark disputes with jupyter for a while. we could take a peek at what he's done.
    * quite a complicated thing. not legal advice. not US citizen. Jupyter trademark has been registered with US govt, owned by numfocus. you have to be careful about defending your trademark. had to deal with trademark infringement. other things to be aware of - jupyter was created because IPython was infringing on python trademark. Have to understand - US Law is not made for people who like to be friendly. When you see companies rewarding shareholders instead of giving money to employees, they're liable to be sued for that. You'd be best if you think like someone who isn't friendly. If you need to defend your trademark you need to prove that you've always defended your trademark, otherwise you run the risk of adversaries saying 'well they didnt defend their trademark so they have no case'. Defending your trademark is pretty broad - anything that anyone could confuse with your project (e.g., Jupyter needs to defend against "Mars" or "Venus" for a similar project). Need to provide explicit authoriziation to use logo and it gets renewed every year. Need to do cease and desist from lawyers. Email sent from individual doesn't really count. Better to have someone infringe and fight it than to never have infringement.
    * tl;dr ->
        * always involve a lawyer (personal email is usually not enough)
        * fight trademark by sending cease and desist or add conditional use. conditional use needs to be renewed every year.
        * If any message in core team chat mentions trademark infringement then now we know about it and we have to fight it or give conditional use.
        * We should make a page about why we have to enforce trademark
            * Example
                * https://www.python.org/psf/trademarks/
                * https://www.python.org/psf/trademarks-faq/
* [x] (WV) bubblewrap for lightweight sandboxing (https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Bubblewrap) -- can we ship a Centos root on conda-forge
* [x] (IF) votes ending today
* [x] (DPC) [Outreachy update](https://hackmd.io/uO6vV2V7T8eDyagZ_y7iQA?both) / call for mentors
    * [Slack Channel](https://conda.slack.com/archives/C031V83JZU3)

* [ ] (JRG) cudatoolkit download/pinning discussion (deferred)
