## Attendees

## Agenda

### Standing items

* [x] intros for new folks on the call

* [x] (CJ) budget
    * current approvals?
    * Whenever updated numbers land, please screenshare and show the budget.
        * Link is in Keybase (numfocus_spreadsheets.txt)

* [x] open votes
    * Cheng for core!

* [ ] (MRB/ED/SC) Roadmap / Funding
    * goal is to spend 15 minutes each core meeting for ~3-4 meetings to discuss this
        * Save last 15 minutes for this.
    * https://hackmd.io/0zGSUS71SbOdBsdLtDmGjg
    * notes will get added to hackmd above
    * MRB will collate into a document of sorts
    * Today I'm gonna ask you all to help us do some data collection on our infrastructure and its risk
        1. Some numbers:
            * https://github.com/conda-forge/by-the-numbers/blob/master/conda-forge-timelines.ipynb
            * conda-forge has added about 3k feedstocks per year in 2019 and will in 2020
            * the growth in the amount of data we store appears to be accelerating
        2. risk measurements
            * CJ deserves all of the credit for this idea
            * https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ADNNauwVZWUsEdlh5aEg0OLjyDWvCX7PLoo-K34EqcM/edit#gid=0
        3. More discussion from last time

#### From previous meeting(s)

### Your __new__() agenda items

* [x] (MRB) propose moving regular core meetings to every two weeks and doing planning in the off week in this time slot

* [x] (MRB) proposed policy on when core pushes to the feedstocks they don't maintain
    * policy would be:
        1. Normal wait time is 3 days for any PR, including migrations, requests for adding maintainers, merging PRs, etc.
        2. In extenuating circumstances (i.e., bad bugs, blocking lots of other PRs/work), core reserves the right to merge before 3 days.
            * Should we have a special "break-glass" label we apply?
            * Two core member rule: If you're going to break-glass and merge before this 3 day window you need two core members to approve (merging is consider implicit approval, as is making the PR)
        3. Core will do its best to not merge PRs marked as in a draft state, either explicitly as a github draft PR or
           through a label, comment, or indication in a title.
        4. Core will do its best to not merge PRs with requested changes (via a comment, label, title, or a PR review), though if the person
           requesting the change is unresponsive to questions or to changes being made, then we may merge.
    * todo
        * [x] (MRB) put in docs PR
        * [ ] (MRB) make PR on bot to mention the policy

* TODO: Check on Forrest Watters permissions for core

* [x] (FF) Outreachy would cost 6500 USD.
      Goal: find a person to work with the bot team on documentation. This person would be mentored by Vini (our GSoC student) and Matt. Outreachy has a higher conversion rate than GSoC, that means the person usually stays in the community helping out later.
  * Next steps: write abstract and vote on spending of funds.

* [x] (IF) Pinning packages with newer macOS requirements
    * For eg:
      - tiledb 2.1 requires 10.13
      - aws-sdk-cpp 1.8.70 requires 10.12 (this is fixed in https://github.com/conda-forge/aws-sdk-cpp-feedstock/pull/153)
    * This effectively brings the required minimum macOS version of the conda-forge stack up to 10.13
    * We should either,
        * Not pin any package that has a minimum macOS version > 10.9 (I'm leaning towards this)
        * Update our minimum macOS version to 10.13
    * Added new docs https://github.com/conda-forge/conda-forge.github.io/pull/1181
    * On a related note, conda's virtual package `__osx` doesn't work as expected
        * Details - https://github.com/conda-forge/fiona-feedstock/issues/172#issuecomment-721832525
    * @mbargull:
        * bioconda moved their default to 10.13 with deploy target as 10.9.
    * Action Items:
        * Poll?
        * Maybe tie it in with apple's deprecation policy?
        * Migrate __osx to a run instead of run_contrained?
            * This would mean these packages will NOT be installable with older conda
        * Build a list of these
        * (CB) Check PyPI macOS access stats
            * Done in https://gist.github.com/chrisburr/d69cc028b2d5a87a749171a7c1c57d77

* [x] (WV) beta.mamba.pm
    * We're setting up a small quetz instance
    * run_exports plugin is enabled, e.g. https://beta.mamba.pm/api/channels/test/packages/bzip2/versions/1.0.8-h516909a_3/run_exports

### Pushed to next meeting

    * INACTIVE - Merge in with some inactive-esque status?

    * **UPDATE 2020-07-22**: We in principle have agreement to render the extra pinnings needed directly in the feedstock
      on a temporary basis (i.e., until the migration has ended).

* [cfep-20](https://github.com/conda-forge/cfep/pull/39)
