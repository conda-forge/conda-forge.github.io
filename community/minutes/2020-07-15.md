# 2020-07-15 conda-forge core meeting


## Attendees

## Agenda

### Standing items
* [x] (CJ) budget, also finance subteam creation
  * https://github.com/conda-forge/conda-forge.github.io/pull/1093
* [x] intros for new folks on the call

### Stuff from last week that we didn't get to

* [x] (ED) Did we need to do anything as a result of this discussion from last week?
    * [x] (IF) strict channel priority
        - Needed for PyPy
        - Needed for Cos7
        - Remove packages that we don't fully support. For eg: there are 3 builds of scipy on windows.
        - Older versions of tensorflow?
            - https://github.com/conda-forge/conda-forge.github.io/issues/1102


* [ ] (ED) Did we need to do anything as a result of this discussion from last week?
    * [x] Discussion of "hard to build packages"
        * rstudio (redist may be somewhat sketchy?)
        * tensorflow
        * qt
        * scipy on Windows
        * Should we publish a list and ask for help on those?

* [x] (UK) Make a NEWS about CFEP-18, add to docs

* [x] (UK) "GPL-free" variants
    - Some packages like Python, sqlite have a dependency on libreadline which is GPL licensed.
      There might be arguments that this doesn't trickle up the stack but Corporate Compliance/IT have a different stance on that.
    - Similar issues with other packages where the GPL-dependency is quite often an optional one.
    - We probably want to have that functionality enabled by default but provide an alternative variant without GPL dependencies.

* How to communicate breaking changes to users?
    1. Make a list of packages that are fundamental to the ecosystem, like [too big to fail](https://github.com/conda-forge/cfep/issues/8)
    2. What kinds of communication do we need for different kinds of changes?
        - communicate breaking changes at the individual repo level
        - communicate CFEP changes
        - communicate known breaking changes to large parts of the ecosystem
        - (discussion) everyone that lives on conda-forge is basically living on master. Could add epoch labels? Snapshot repodata.json labels. @Isuru / @kirkham move to github issue?

* [ ] (CL) msys2 packages
    - Anaconda deciding on update plans for "defaults" channel
    - No immediate action needed at this time

### Your new agenda items

* [ ] (CJ) rebuild migraiton automerges default
    - Currently either automerge is on or off, but it would be good to allow ppl to
      choose to automerge only for rebuilds and not version updates
    - These automerges may be safer than version automerges, since the deps
    - don't change and the build is more likely to fail if the package would be broken.
    - https://github.com/regro/cf-scripts/pull/1063

* [ ] (CJ) s390x support
    - https://github.com/conda-forge/conda-smithy/issues/1359
* [ ] (FF) new conda-build release that fixes the Windows prefix issue
      https://github.com/conda/conda-build/issues/3909#issuecomment-626586540
* [x] (FF) CZI proposal
      https://docs.google.com/document/d/1dEXQsrXM5kBW6ARLpsVGRQltVxQVbVkjmXbBh8LnHac

* [ ] (ED) Who we are page? Some combination of a FAQ and a who is everyone. FAQ things like:
    * who's the POC for CF <> Anaconda, CF <> NumFocus, CF <> Azure
    * who's the POC for the various subteams?
    * Informal information: roles, day jobs, bios, the whole nine yards, why you're here, etc.
