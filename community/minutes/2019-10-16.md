# 2019-10-16 conda-forge core meeting 

## Attendees

## Agenda

### Your agenda items
(Filipe) Should we try GSoC? If so, should we try under the NumFOCUS umbrella? Deadline is Monday, October 28 at 17:00 UTC!
Discussion: 
* Ideas?
    * Should be straightforward to get started
    * Should have a meaningful impact
    * Should have a meaningful endpoint
* Willing to mentor?
* Start creating/tagging issues GSoC or maybe build a project of issues
* Need to find students
    * CJ: Put out feelers
    * Can be undergrad or grad
    * Anthony: Tweet out we're looking for people who want to champion  GSOC?

(CJ) Python 3.8 progress
Discussion:
* Windows issue is pretty nasty. (https://github.com/conda-forge/python-feedstock/pull/274#issuecomment-542331428)
* Something's up with macos (fixed if you don't build with LTO - Link Time Optimization - but that's more fun)
* Jonathan has linux packages with py38 label on his anaconda.org channel.

### Subteam updates

#### Bot
- (CJ) License bot is operational.
    - Upstream to conda skeleton? Show Filipe that part of the code [link](https://github.com/regro/cf-scripts/blob/master/conda_forge_tick/migrators.xsh#L99)
    - List of all feedstocks that dont have a license: [link](https://github.com/regro/cf-graph-countyfair/blob/master/status/unlicensed.json)
- (CJ) libnetcdf and zstd migrations are up
- (CJ) CFEP9 docs went up, seemed to help new users with issuing PRs

#### ARM

#### Docs

#### staged-recipes

#### website

### CI infrastructure

#### Compiler upgrade

### CFEP updates
How do we start getting traction on these?

#### [cfep-03](https://github.com/conda-forge/conda-forge-enhancement-proposals/pull/5) Manual upload of builds
* Filipe to review, fix any text and merge it in.

#### [cfep-04](https://github.com/conda-forge/conda-forge-enhancement-proposals/pull/7) X11 and CDT policy

#### [cfep-05](https://github.com/conda-forge/conda-forge-enhancement-proposals/pull/3) dev/rc builds
- It seems that the `conda install label::package` syntax gives some odd/unexpected results
- Maybe we should build a cron job that tests some expected environments?
- discussion:
    - doesn't 
    - automated dev builds: opt-in?
    - enable maintainers to ask for a new PR to be created for a dev release.

#### [cfep-06](https://github.com/conda-forge/conda-forge-enhancement-proposals/pull/9) Staged-recipes review lifecycle

#### cfep-08 Too Big To Fail
- Tabled for the time being
- CJ: Merge this in with the Deferred Status.

#### [cfep-10](https://github.com/conda-forge/conda-forge-enhancement-proposals/pull/15) Feedstock statuses, unmaintained
- How to handle being a collection of packages "which work" and/or an archival store.
- Epoching of the conda-forge channel
    - Epoching in conda
        - two indexes `current_repodata.json` and `repodata.json`
        - Build on this idea for more epochs
    - Shallow graph thing
    - Put time slice repodata.json file on CDN?
    - enable `conda install package -date=Jan2019`
- Purpose of conda-forge: Reproducibility vs replicability vs new stuff that just works
    - Ways in which we can help with reproducibility:
        - label all packages with "reproducible" or "all"
        - lock/freeze your environment
        - conda create with locked environment pointing to the "all" channel of conda-forge
        - Best Practices on using conda, conda files, environment.yml, construct.yml, anaconda.org, local channels, etc.

* [ ] (Filipe) Progress on setting up a self-hosted blog
    * Medium seems to be generally downvoted
    * Host your own blog seems to be generally positive
    * Can we mimic what Dask does for their dev blog? https://github.com/dask/dask-blog
* [ ] (Needs Owner) Searching on our website is a little difficult
* [ ] (Filipe, Anthony) Improve docs on releasing conda-smithy. Currently says "use rever". Would be good to fill out more info there for those of us that are unfamiliar with rever.
