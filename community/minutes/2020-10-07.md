## Attendees
    
## Agenda

### Standing items

* [x] intros for new folks on the call
    * (AS) Stephanie and Paul!
        * Rely pretty heavily on conda and pull from conda-forge. Looking to participate in that. Looking to make sure packages are secure and traceable

* [x] (CJ) budget
    * current approvals?
    * First meeting of the month, screenshare and show the budget?
        * Link is in Keybase (numfocus_spreadsheets.txt)
        * reimbursement request for Anthony isn't showing up yet.
        * (AS) - I have resubmitted to rocket.

#### From previous meeting(s)

* [x] (CJ) libcfgraph import tables
    * example: https://github.com/regro/libcfgraph/blob/master/import_maps/ag.json
    * only looks at .py files so probably does not cover compiled extensions
    * next move is to integrate with depfinder
    * still thinking about how to turn this info into a version requirement
    * Should we turn this into a service? Anyone interested, feel free to open up an issue.
        * Would OVH be interested in hosting this?

### Your new agenda items

* [x] (FF) Python 3.9 update?
    * wait for Ray to weigh in on something
* [x] (MRB/IF/ER/CL) osx-arm64
    * code signing on osx-arm
        * status of conda PR
        * Eli reports that the conda PR works great
* [x] (Wolf) can I use our arm server for robostack?
* [x] (Wolf) upload from robostack pipelines to conda-forge?
    * need to add a policy to staged-recipes where nothing can be added with a "ros-" prefix without pinging wolf.
    * making smithy smarter about this stuff would help a lot
* [x] (IF) automatically generate sysconfigdata files for python
* [x] (MRB) migtoberfest
    * we have three migrations queued up or about to be
        * cuda 11: ~20 feedstocks
        * gfortran 9.3.0: ~320 feedstocks
        * python 3.9: ~thousands of feedstocks
    * should we launch them as they are ready, or should we hold back on one or two?
        * all of them!
    * need to figure gfortran tail char thing
* [x] (Scopz) Can we make a cudatoolkit package or not?
    * I seem to recall that we can, but Isuru seems to think we need something more in writing
        * (KK) nvbugs/3052604: Internal NVIDIA tracking system and ticket number that gives explicit permission to conda-forge for a cudatoolkit conda package for the redistributable pieces per the EULA.
            * Subject to matching the Description, License text + URL, and post-link messaging in this package: https://anaconda.org/nvidia/cudatoolkit
    * This is related to a lack of cudatoolkit v10.1.243 for linux-ppc64le, which is the Summit arch
* [x] (KK) CUDA compatibility changes in 11.x+
    * major versions will maintain SONAMES

    * (MRB) The stalebot has solved the worst of the issues here. I think we could defer this one permanently.

* [cfep-10](https://github.com/conda-forge/conda-forge-enhancement-proposals/pull/15) Feedstock statuses, unmaintained
    * INACTIVE - Merge in with some inactive-esque status?
    * Needs another review. Has unaddressed updates from pkgw as of Jan 11, 2020

    * Active debate about moving to "broken" vs deleting from conda-forge channel
    * Active vote, ends on 2020-03-11
    * What were the results of the vote?
    * Did we hear back from NumFOCUS?

* [cfep-17](https://github.com/conda-forge/cfep/pull/32) Handling pin backports and dependency rebuilds
    * Stalled debate about implementation details between Isuru, CJ and Matt
    * **UPDATE 2020-07-22**: We in principle have agreement to render the extra pinnings needed directly in the feedstock 
      on a temporary basis (i.e., until the migration has ended).
