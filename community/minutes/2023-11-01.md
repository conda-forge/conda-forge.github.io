### Your `__new__()` agenda items

- [x] (JK) We/NVIDIA are hiring.
    - https://nvidia.wd5.myworkdayjobs.com/NVIDIAExternalCareerSite/job/US-CA-Remote/Senior-Engineer--Infrastructure--Build--and-Packaging---RAPIDS_JR1973615
- [x] (HV) next steps for MacOS 10.13
    - jinja for `stdlib("c")` was merged into conda-build (not yet released)
    - what's the next step? admin migration to add `{{ stdlib("c") }}` wherever there's a `{{ compiler("c") }}`?
    - MRB recommends agains an admin migration as too intrusive.  Be better to have a mini-migrator that rolls it out to new feed stocks.
    - JRG: 4.3k recipes with `compiler('c')` ([gh search](https://github.com/search?q=org%3Aconda-forge+path%3Ameta.yaml+compiler%28%22c%22%29+OR+compiler%28%27c%27%29&type=code))
    - MRB will comment about places where (linux) sysroot is set in our infra in the [issue](https://github.com/conda-forge/conda-forge.github.io/issues/1844).
    - WV will open an issue or a CFEP for this discussion.
    - This issue came up because there is a part of the build that is hidden, it is not exposed anywhere
- [x] (HV) Tracking issue for CUDA 12 on win?
    - https://github.com/conda-forge/cuda-nvcc-feedstock got windows support today
    - Something like [https://github.com/conda-forge/staged-recipes/issues/21382] for windows?
    - JK: No issue yet. Would be good to confirm that it works before we start rolling it out everywhere
- [x] (WV) First CEP for recipe spec accepted :tada: ... now unto the next
    - https://github.com/conda-incubator/ceps/blob/main/cep-13.md (accepted)
    - https://github.com/conda-incubator/ceps/pull/56 (the next one!)
    - Pure YAML. 
    - There is another CEP for key/values.
    - Drastic changes to multiple outputs.
    - Large changes to the test section.
        - List of tests, composed of test elements.
    - JRG: only ~100 recipes use `for` loops [[search](https://github.com/search?q=org%3Aconda-forge%20path%3Arecipe%2Fmeta.yaml%20%22%7B%25%20for%22&type=code)]
    - (MRB) Be careful when just abandoning keys in current spec.  They were put there for a reason. Try to understand those reasons, even if we don't keep them.
- [x] (MB) Intent to archive `ruamel_yaml` feedstock
    - https://github.com/conda-forge/ruamel_yaml-feedstock/issues/107
    - conda now dependent on upstream version.
- [x] (DPC) Anything to highlight in the November conda newsletter?
- [ ] (DPC) Is it time to get off twitter?
    - FF: We should mmove period.
        - BlueSky account is secured.
        - Not clear which Mastodon server we should use
        - It's a slow move. We should have both for some time. 
        - Point Twitter to new one
        - Dave and Filipe will coordinate across conda-forge and conda.
