### Your __new__() agenda items

- [x] (JRG): New conda-forge.org website tour and plans (https://github.com/conda-forge/conda-forge.github.io/issues/1971).
    - Migrated to Docusaurus (also used in conda.org)
    - What should we do with documentation site?
        - There is organization documentation (how the org works). This is more of a community section.
    - Coming next: announcements page migration to news/.
    - Use last updated repos API for the `feedstock-outputs`
- [x] (DPC) Conda-Forge off of twitter now, damn it.
    - Filipe is mostly out for next 10 days or so.
    - So, put this on hold.
- [x] (DPC) Google Summer of Code 2024
  - Advice from NumFOCUS for 2024:
    - A key lesson learnt from last year is that Google‚Äôs approach to selecting projects is not well suited to umbrella organizations like NumFOCUS. This year, we heavily recommend projects which can apply on their own to do so. We encourage you to explore and propose projects in the AI/ML space. We also expect more potential GSoC contributors to be looking for AI/ML related ideas.
  - From Google
    - We are looking forward to having more AI/ML open source organizations involved in GSoC 2024
  - Is there interest in a conda-forge for GSOC 2024?
  - Is there interest from conda-forge in a conda-wide application?
  - Or would that be an umbrella organization? üôÅ
  - Wolf will lead the effort.
- [x] (JK) CUDA
    - Closing CUDA 11.8 (PR up)
        - https://github.com/conda-forge/conda-forge-pinning-feedstock/pull/5340
