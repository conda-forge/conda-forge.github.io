  All we need now is a blog ;-p
  * https://conda-forge.org/blog/

### Subteam updates

#### Bot
- (CJ) Major bot refactor has finished, most of the code is now in IDE friendly, type hinted python
- (CJ) Matt Becker has joined the bot subteam
    - wants to push on auto-merging green bot PRs. At least looking at what infrastructure needs to be set up for that.
        - (Marcel) makes sense if its opt-in. 
        - (Eric) would suggest opt-in at start to work out kinks, once stable switch to opt-out.
    - look at issue tracker for more info
    - UX around abandoned feedstocks? pseudo-abandoned
- (CJ) Version bump PRs now close open version PRs for previous versions
    - Merging the newer version bump PR will close the older version bump PR.
- (jakirkham) use linter bot to update bot's graph with PR status

#### ARM

#### POWER

#### CUDA

* (jakirkham) CUDA 10.2 migration
    * (CJ) the bot doesn't handle run_exports at all. It's particularly glaring with run_exports strong. Usually fuse host / run to figure dependencies. Does not use build for dependency tracking. Has some notes / issues that descirbes this a bit https://github.com/regro/cf-scripts/issues/677. TODO: Make a lookup table for the strong run_exports. Before making edges in graph, add in the run_exports strong requirements to the dependencies. This should propery express dependencies in the graph.
    * (jakirkham) needs pointers from CJ as to where in the bot to make these updates.
    * (CJ) question: Using `render` from the conda public API. This doesn't seem to add the run_exports to the meta.yaml. Is there another function to use that does add the run_exports to the rendered? A: this function needs all of the jinja variables provided or the rendered dictionary wont be correct.
    * (jakirkham) Discussion to have. Break cudatoolkit into two packages: cudatoolkit runtime and the rest.

#### Docs

#### staged-recipes

#### website

### CI infrastructure

#### Compiler upgrade

### CFEP updates

#### Open PRs

* [cfep-03](https://github.com/conda-forge/conda-forge-enhancement-proposals/pull/5) Manual upload of builds
    * Has 10 approvals, what are next steps here?
    * Merged today!

* [cfep-04](https://github.com/conda-forge/conda-forge-enhancement-proposals/pull/7) X11 and CDT policy
    * jjhelmus to add a comment to this PR about what we discussed today. Ping jjhelmus about tk. It's not clear if we can even build tk against a non system X11 because tk ships its own X11 headers that the conda X11 package doesn't work against

* [cfep-05](https://github.com/conda-forge/conda-forge-enhancement-proposals/pull/3) dev/rc builds
    * Seems that there was voting, but did anything come of it?
    * CJ to make formal vote call on this. Will check in next week
        * Vote issued

* [cfep-06](https://github.com/conda-forge/conda-forge-enhancement-proposals/pull/9) Staged-recipes review lifecycle
    * Has some recent comments from @saraedum that are unaddressed
    * Ask staged-recipes team to champion this CFEP and move it forward.

* [cfep-10](https://github.com/conda-forge/conda-forge-enhancement-proposals/pull/15) Feedstock statuses, unmaintained
    * Discussion around maintainers removing themselves
    * Maybe move to a x number of versions away from most recent
    * https://github.com/regro/cf-graph-countyfair/blob/master/status/could_use_help.json
    * CJ to make a call to vote
