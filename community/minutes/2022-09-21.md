### Standing items

* [x] intros for new folks on the call
    * mark - software engineer - here to talk about julia

    * ED will take on the call for a vote.

### From previous meeting(s)

### Your __new__() agenda items

* [x] (JK) CUDA licensing update
    * new CUDA license amendment proposal
    * NVIDIA wants the option to remove packages if needed
    * MRB - packages could only be built with nvidia approved scripts? feels somewhat anti-community
    * JK wants people to share feedback on the proposal.
* [X] (MK/IF) packages depending on julia packages
* [ ] (DPC) Does conda-forge have an interest in directing our community towards the soon to be announced [conda Discourse site](https://conda.discourse.group/)?
    * Could see a lot of traffic moving from Gitter to the [Package Builders category](https://conda.discourse.group/c/pkg-building/15) in Discourse (possibly in a conda-forge subcategory?)
    * Could also see some discussion happening in the [Contributors ⇒ Infra category](https://conda.discourse.group/c/contrib/infra/13) (or in a conda-forge subcategory)
    * Site is going live next week.
* [ ] (AO) new python patch releases & breaking changes in int()/str() roundtrip (limit of 4300 characters)
    * https://discuss.python.org/t/int-str-conversions-broken-in-latest-python-bugfix-releases/18889 
    * https://github.com/conda-forge/python-feedstock/pull/579 (initial feeling was to wait, but upstream will not change back it seems)
    * Indefinitely holding up patch releases not an option IMO; people get CVE warnings for older releases.
    * Thoughts?
    * (CHL) While we're at it, what should we do about CVE-2015-20107 (mailcap)?
        * [3.10 backport](https://github.com/python/cpython/pull/93543) finally got accepted
* [ ] (MRB) anything we should think about with cirrus-ci for apple silicon?
    * [ ] status of native-native compilers?
    * [ ] need a smithy PR OFC
    * [ ] do we want to get in touch with them directly?
* [ ] (AO) cross-compile CUDA on aarch64/ppc64le?
    * Inspired by arrow-cpp where building CUDA on aarch forces all of aarch to be emulated (cannot distinguish build_platform in conda-forge.yml based on CUDA)
    * The emulated builds time out ~50% of the time, and switching PPC over as well would mean we'd need 5-6 restarts of 6h runs each for passing CI
    * Idea was to figure out the missing pieces (ties into the EULA discussion since KK said we cannot use bits of the existing (e.g.) ppc-images conformantly)
    * AFAIU, we'd "only" need an aarch64/ppc64le libcuda stub as a host lib within the x64 build image, but most likely I'm overlooking a bunch of stuff.


### Active votes

* [cfep-21](https://github.com/conda-forge/cfep/pull/47) license packages for static/header libraries
	* Opened July 25, 2022 ends August 2, 2022


### CFEPs

* [cfep-12](https://github.com/conda-forge/cfep/pull/23) Removing packages that violate the terms of the source package
    * Stalled since May 26, 2020
    * Active debate about moving to "broken" vs deleting from conda-forge channel
    * Active vote, ends on 2020-03-11
    * What were the results of the vote?
    * Did we hear back from NumFOCUS? they did the legal seminar which is recorded

### TODOs
[2022-06-15](https://hackmd.io/tdkRcPT3QCSkGkABpuKmTg)
* [ ] (MvN) vs2022 compiler support
    * Initial stab at some pieces https://github.com/conda-forge/vc-feedstock/pull/46
    * This is a new VC version
        * Uses existing UCRT
    * Would need to use the windows-2022 github actions image
    * TODO: follow on to change the name of the runtime to vc_runtime
    * TODO: will need patches for msys epoch for UCRT
    * (CHL) For reference: [msys2 environments](https://www.msys2.org/docs/environments/) - pick your own compiler + libstdc++ + Windows runtime adventure 
    * https://www.msys2.org/docs/package-naming/
    * (RG) "we need some version of mingw-w64 for SciPy 1.9.0 too, MSVC + gfortran will no longer work. we use an Rtools toolchain in CI now"
* [ ] (CHL) How does conda-forge use channeldata.json?
    * Only known use by c-f: counting # of package namespaces for "By the numbers" on the webpage; other uses deprecated
    * TODO: CEP to deprecate & remove `--use-channeldata` from `conda-build`
    * TODO: CEP to add run exports to `repodata.json`

[2022-04-05](https://hackmd.io/CqkOlf0XQMOh23Wnmt9qTQ)

* TODO: Articulate suggested mechanism for "so you're thinking about taking a contract to work on conda-forge". tl;dr is you should work on a design doc with the impacted parties (or working groups, or interested folks) on the conda-forge side. Once you have agreement on the scope, delivery timeline, and anything that's needed from the conda-forge volunteer side, go ahead and sign that contract with your payer. if you don't do this first, you may encounter some difficulties finishing delivery of your contractual agreement with your payer.
