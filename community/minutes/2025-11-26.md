### Your __new__() agenda items

- [X] WV: Demos
  - `rattler-build debug-shell` and assisted patch creation directly from $PREFIX
  - `rattler-build inspect` to print metadata about .conda artifacts
  - `rattler-build publish` will build and upload a package; for S3 and local fs it also runs the indexing process. A `--generation-attestation` flag runs `cosign` locally (equivalent to GHA)
- [X] BZ: Demos
    - Conditional dependencies in `rattler-bin`. Conditional specs also working in libsolv.
        - JRG: Awesome, this should work as the reference for libmamba too.
    - CEPs?
        - Jaime to take over https://github.com/conda/ceps/pull/111, and apply split and editorial suggestions. Keyword-based `if`-conditions are welcome.
        - Probably need to finalize https://github.com/conda/ceps/pull/82 and others first
        - Start technical review committee for CEPs?
        - Timeline: 3 months at least, hopefully in time for FOSSDEM.
- [X] CHL: Skipping meetings in December/January?
    - JRG: Probably 2nd half of December, 1st week of January.
    - CHL: To confirm next week in conda-community
- [X] JRG: Intent to merge conda-forge core and conda community calls in 2026
