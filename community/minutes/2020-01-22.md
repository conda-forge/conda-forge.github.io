# 2020-01-22 conda-forge core meeting 


## Attendees

## Agenda

### Your agenda items

* Recurring Anaconda update on what's going on on our side.

* (jakirkham) What's the plan for conda / conda-build moving forward?
    * who's taking over maintenance of these projects going forward?
    * Opportunity to onboard someone new from not Anaconda?
        * Is Anaconda open to opening up permissions on conda-build to others?
            * Michael S once he leaves? 
            * Marcel Bargull?
            * Marcelo Trevisani?

* Anacondacon
    * (CJ) breakout session submitted to AnacondaCON
        * deep dive into the automation systems used by conda-forge
    * conda-forge / Anaconda / bioconda / RAPIDS / wolfv (Quantstack & RooS & mamba) summit at Anacondacon?
        * (Eric) check internally for funding levels for hotels & flying folks from the community in?
        * (Eric) Figure out finances of conda-forge to support themselves?
* (FF) Drop python 2.7
    * (Eric) Open up a CFEP about what to do about Python 2.7.
    * We probably need a statement that says when and why we're dropping py27
    * Anaconda has stopped building py27 packages
    * After the next Anaconda distro release (Feb/March)
    * Anaconda will build the CPython interpreter for py27 when it comes out in March
    * Coordinate timing between Anaconda and conda-forge on python 2.7.
    * Should we make there be a way to "opt-in" to continue building python 2.7 packages?
    * Idea: 
        * Remove python 2.7 from the conda-forge pinnings.
        * Migration to update the feedstocks so they drop python 2.7
        * Have a bot command to let people opt-out

* (Eric) What Pythons are we going to support? 3.6-3.8? 
    * (jjhelmus) Open up a CFEP for this.
    * We have a weak policy (more of a tradition, really) on supporting three python versions -- this was 2.7 plus the most recent 3.x versions.
    * The conda-forge policy was mirroring Anaconda's policy.
    * Should we mirror the CPython policy?
        * Disadvantage is that we will have up to 5 versions in 2021.

* (Eric) Push scheduling to one week out and then every other week.

Push everything below this to next week
* (FF) The blog is "ready" but we need a Jekyll expert to take a look at it.
  The layout and page publication is not OK.
