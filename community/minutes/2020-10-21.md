## Agenda

### Standing items

* [x] intros for new folks on the call
    * Bill - new to Anaconda. On the distribution team with Cheng and Connor.

* [x] (CJ) budget
    * current approvals?
    * Whenever updated numbers land, please screenshare and show the budget.
        * Link is in Keybase (numfocus_spreadsheets.txt)

* [x] (MRB) open votes
    * Chris Burr for Core
    * Won't use polys again because something totally went sideways. Maybe we'll try again?

#### From previous meeting(s)

* [x] (MRB) github releases and conda-forge-sparta
    * code and data in the regro github org right now
        * if you want access, LMK
        * I am also happy to move the repos to the conda-forge org but they may slow rerendering since they use a fair bit of github actions
    * how it works
        * all packages that are validated and copied to anaconda.org/conda-forge are also 
          sent to a releases repo via a workflow dispatch event in github actions
        * the github actions CI job (regro/releases)
            * downloads the package
            * computes its repodata information
            * uploads the package and its repodata as a github release
            * pushes the repodata shard to another repo with all of the shards
        * another job on a continuous loop (regro/repodata aka the repoworker)
            * downloads the shards
            * figures out which ones are new
            * applies repodata patching to the shards (will also repatch everything if patches have changed)
            * computes the repodata and channel data
            * computes an index of links that point to where one can download the package
            * uploads all of this data as a github release
            * kicks the heroku server to download the new links
        * the herkou server (https://conda-forge-sparta.herokuapp.com/conda-forge-sparta/)
            * gets a request for a package or repodata file at the standard URL for an anaconda server
            * looks up where that package is in the links index
            * issues a 300 to redirect the request to the actual location
        * a final set of cron jobs runs once an hour to sync our repodata shards with anaconda.org (regro/repodata-shards)
            * this job catches any missed releases due to bad CI jobs or manual uploads
                * will update the shards repo and upload to github
            * ensures eventual consistency on ~1-2 hour time scales if things break
    * overall time delay from the initial workflow dispatch to a package being available is 5-10 minutes
        * can go longer if repodata patches are being redone for everything
    * how could this not depend on anaconda **if we needed it**
        * replace cf-staging and anaconda.org w/ quetz
        * limit traffic to those instances to keep the costs down
        * send the vast majority of download requests to our (possibly beefed up) heroku server and thus github
    * I really don't want to maintain this for production, but we could if we had to.
    * For now, we have a system to help index and archive our data in another spot.

* [ ] (MRB / ED / SC) Roadmap / Funding? Discussion in gitter:
    * (SC) What would CF do as a project if it received funding? Maybe having some kind of whitepapers on the conda-forge website would help. Would conda-forge do something very different if some corporation gave 10k, 100k, or 1M to the project via NumFOCUS? 
        * 10k: does it buy enough hosting to do something interesting? 
        * 100k - what does it bring. 
        * A much larger amount: conda-forge may even be able to have funded people directly working on the project.
        * We can almost certainly find a lot useful stuff that would not hurt getting funding for without necessarily having to get consensus on a roadmap. (something i think would not be controversial, like oh we could use some funding to do some nice web development for better visualization of migrations, or stuff) there are probably a lor of things of that nature.
    * If we make a list, Santa may just show up...
    * see the bloomberg note above...
    * wishlist and ideas: https://hackmd.io/0zGSUS71SbOdBsdLtDmGjg
        * (ED) Can we add initials for whomever submitted the idea? would be useful to track that if there are follow-on questions
        * (MRB) Start chatting on this for 15 minutes in the next core meeting

* [x] (MvN) tactical things to do about cython?
    * CPython breaks its apis reguarly enough to force a recythoning of much of the python ecosystem.
    * Should we patch our cython so that when the  `CONDA_BUILD` env var is set, we always recythonize and ignore mtime for files?

* [x] (MvN) noarch: python v2
    * As we increasingly drop compatibility with py27/35/36 should we automatically add python constraints to all `noarch: python` artifacts using repodata pacthing?
        * The idea would be to pick an epoch date (say 2020-10-01) and have the artifacts built after that date get a repodata patch adding a python>=3.6 constraint iff it only had a python constraint.
    
    * Additionally we may as well upate the noarch adding bot action that adds noarch to strip all lines containing py27/34/35 selectors from the recipe.
        * This should allow us to move lots of feedstocks that currently depend on some things only for py27 compat to noarch: python cutting down on the growth rate of artifacts. 
    * to do
        * ( ) [ ] make a hint
        * ( ) [ ] make an announcement
        * ( ) [ ] make the hint a lint

* [x] (WV) multisheller github.com/wolfv/multisheller

### Your __new__() agenda items

* [x] (FF) Outreachy, round 2
* [X] (FF) "Feature parity" between feedstock and staged-recipes. For example: CFEP-05 does not contemplate a dev release on staged recipes when there is no stable release to start a feedstock. https://github.com/conda-forge/cfep/blob/master/cfep-05.md
    * No need for a conda-forge.yml, one can add a conda config file
    * The broader issue still is not solved, we cannot do cos7
    * staged recipes needs some work!

* [cfep-10](https://github.com/conda-forge/conda-forge-enhancement-proposals/pull/15) Feedstock statuses, unmaintained
    * INACTIVE - Merge in with some inactive-esque status?
    * Needs another review. Has unaddressed updates from pkgw as of Jan 11, 2020

      on a temporary basis (i.e., until the migration has ended).
