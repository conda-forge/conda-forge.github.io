# 2020-04-01 conda-forge core meeting 


## Attendees
 - MS, ED, LB, CJ, AS, MB, Matt B, FF, JH, Uwe

## Agenda

### Your agenda items
* [Matt B] 
  - Should we have an official policy around updates/support for our compiler stack? 
      - they are not interested in paid support. 
      - If there is a switch they are going to get a loud alert? (YES!)
          - The main problem that the LSST called out was the gcc 5 break.
      - answer: no policy because we don't have the bandwidth - it is done adhoc, expect gcc9 in the next 2-3 years
  - Also do we have a name for our compiler stack? (gcc7?)
  - For context, I got a query from a big scientific project (the data management team for the Vera Rubin Observatory).
    They are moving their entire software stack to use conda-forge + it's compilers (based on work I did for them
    showing them how to do it! yay!). They are wondering about how the compilers might change in the next 2-3 years and 
    what label they might apply to their internal systems to track the compiler stack version as a whole. Note they 
    only use linux and osx AFAIK.

* We should publish the way that we decide what pinnings to use and when things change.
    
* Update to gcc 9? jjhelmus wants it done soon, but definitely sometime in the next 2 years
    * gfortran compat break between 7 and 8.  9 is compatible with 8. Details at https://gcc.gnu.org/wiki/LibgfortranAbiCleanup

### Active votes

### Subteam updates

#### Bot
* [CJ] Bot auto issues migrator PRs into pinnings
    * What cadence do we want for these? Do maintainers decide? Where would this live?
* [CJ] Should we wait for a version beyond R `4.0.0` for migration (mostly a question for the bioconda folks)?

* What are we updating when?
 - root break micro but we push everything
 - hdf5 breaks everything so we do that once a year
 - libnetcdf is pinned to micro version
 - boost pin to micro do every other
 - tiledb (3 breaks in 18 days, over pinned so should be at 'x.x' instead of 'x.x.x')
 - protobuf breaks at micro (~once a year)
 
* proposed solution:
 - bot team put the rules of thumb above into some form in pinnings 
 - will be documented
 - core will defer to maintainers
 - we'll see how this goes...
