### Your __new__() agenda items

- [x] (IF) Installing latest sysroot compatible with the user's system
    - https://github.com/conda-forge/linux-sysroot-feedstock/pull/75
    - If you export an environment using a lockfile and reproduce you might get an incompatible sysroot.
    - MRB: Is there a shim we can use to use the system bits with our compilers? Is this PR providing that solution or a different one?
        - IF: It's a slightly different problem. With this PR, users will get the most recent sysroot available for their system (instead of the pinned/oldest one). Currently, 2.28 in conda-forge.
    - MRB: Are both solutions compatible?
        - IF: They are compatible. Using the system sysroot should be explicitly opt-in (only if "they know what they are doing"). We shouldn't encourage it and instead prefer the "latest compatible one" provided by conda-forge.
    - IF: The lockfile incompatibility problem is trying to install it in an older GLIBC system. The lockfile should include the `__glibc` virtual package in these cases.
        - JRG: Capture this in an issue in conda/conda and maybe a CEP.
- [x] (JRG) Improvements in CI provisioning times in Windows / macOS:
    - Windows-only: move base install to D:
    - Both: use micromamba by default
    - Linux: still using Docker images... how to approach this? new series of Docker images with suffixed names so they don't use `Miniforge` installs? We can keep the same pinning entries, but not sure how hacky this feels.
        - IF: Add micromamba to the Docker images. The added size is negligible, and just use micromamba instead of Miniforge to provision the base environment. Make sure to use the same cache.
