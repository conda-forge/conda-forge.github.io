### Your __new__() agenda items

- [X] (JK) NumPy 2.0
    - Discussion about how to get more info about NumPy version used in a build
        - https://github.com/numpy/numpy/pull/24861
        - https://github.com/conda-forge/conda-forge.github.io/issues/1997
- [X] (HV) archspec-enabled packages
  - leaving lots of perf on the table; distros moving to x64-v2 or [even](https://www.phoronix.com/news/CentOS-ISA-Experiment-Perform) v3 baseline ()
  - [CF issue](https://github.com/conda-forge/conda-forge.github.io/issues/1261) open since ~2.5yrs; [CEP issue](https://github.com/conda-incubator/ceps/issues/59) a few months ago -- next steps?
  - (IF,CHL) We could probably re-purpose the existing `__archspec` virtual package to expose/proxy the HWCAPS/feature level; would not require additional changes conda to get some support for tuned packages
    - See https://github.com/conda-incubator/ceps/issues/59#issuecomment-1636844274
    - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X86-64#Microarchitecture_levels
  - (CHL) CEP potentially goes way deeper and would expose things like individual CPU feature flags. (Original in-person discussion at SciPy 2023 was around discovering specific AVX-512, AES-NI, and ARM instructions.)
- [X] (BH) Where is the best place to learn about/peek into conda-forge build automation?
  - Feedstock builds: conda-smithy provides the starting configuration, conda-forge-ci-setup handles some stuff at runtime, docker-images creates the base image for Linux. Automation around feedstocks... regro/cf-scripts is the start.
  - https://cf-infra-docs.netlify.app/docs/fundamentals/life-cycle/ for some big picture docs (non-official)
- [X] (JK) m2 recipes
    - https://github.com/conda-forge/staged-recipes/pull/24112
    - https://github.com/conda-forge/m2-builds
    - conda-msys2:matrix.org
- [x] (JK) AlmaLinux 8
    - CDTs need to be setup
- [x] (JK) macOS 10.13
    - https://github.com/conda-forge/conda-forge.github.io/issues/1844
    - https://github.com/conda/conda-build/pull/4999
        - Needs reviews
- [x] (JK) Windows ARM
    - compatibility status?
    - conda-forge usage
    - (IF) Got Windows ARM machine 
    - (IF) Need to gen GHA token to give to them for CI setup (planned at end of month)
    - (IF) Will need to some cross-compilation to support building some of the packages for Windows ARM (from x86_64)
    - (MRB) Load?
        - (IF) Not worried about this as ramp up time will be long
        - (IF) They also will give us more if needed
    - (JRG) Have admin service logic to add/remove CI services
- [X] (HV) Asking Microsoft for more CI jobs
    - (JRG) Moving to GHA as an option
        - (MRB) Need to be careful having jobs that generate jobs on GHA (DoS risk)
- [X] (JK) Conda/conda-build/mamba/boa/Miniforge
    - (JRG) Can use `conda-libmamba-solver` in `conda-build` (starting w/23.9.0)
        - This has also been tested in staged-recipes
    - (WV) Regarding `boa`, might be best to move `conda-build` with `conda-libmamba-solver`
        - (HV) Will this allow us to update `conda-build` in feedstocks
            - Yes +3
    - (JRG) Can also opt-in with `conda-forge.yml`
        - Link: https://conda-forge.org/docs/maintainer/conda_forge_yml.html#conda-build-tool
    - (JK) Let's test on feedstocks a bit and see how it goes
- [X] (CA) CDN issues
    - granular package delay monitoring coming soon
    - some packages can't be downloaded from CDN
        - Files were uploaded, but no release record was added
        - Now working on fixing the 20-30 packages affected in cf
        - Also adding logic now to track delay time
        - 
- [X] (JRG/WV) CZI EOSS6 LOI submission: https://github.com/conda-forge/conda-forge.github.io/pull/2019
