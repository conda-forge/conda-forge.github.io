### Your `__new__()` agenda items

- [x] (HV) Bump OSX compilers to [clang 18](https://github.com/conda-forge/conda-forge-pinning-feedstock/pull/6571)
- [x] (HV) Basic infrastructure for [Alma 9](https://github.com/conda-forge/conda-forge.github.io/issues/2342)
  - Thanks to a bunch of consolidation and automation for [sysroot](https://github.com/conda-forge/linux-sysroot-feedstock/pull/79), [CDTs](https://github.com/conda-forge/cdt-builds/blob/main/cdt_slugs.yaml) & images ([pending](https://github.com/conda-forge/docker-images/pull/287)), this became very easy to add now.
  - Note: CDTs do not contain distro or glibc version anymore, just `conda`. This works because constraints on `sysroot_linux-<arch>` and `__glibc` ensure separation.
- [x] (HV) Upgrading default images to alma8 (for finishing alma8 [rollout](https://github.com/conda-forge/conda-forge.github.io/issues/1941))
  - Last blocker is around usage of `yum_requirements.txt`, I did a [survey](https://github.com/conda-forge/conda-forge-pinning-feedstock/issues/6283#issuecomment-2440281086) and it looks like we can update to alma8 with minimal issues ([PR](https://github.com/conda-forge/conda-forge-pinning-feedstock/pull/6626))
  - AFAICT, we should be able to get rid of `DEFAULT_LINUX_VERSION` completely
  - (MRB) I think we can deprecate the `DEFAULT_LINUX_VERSION` option in smithy too if we remove it from the pinnings
  - CONCLUSION: reenable it per issue here: https://github.com/conda-forge/conda-forge-pinning-feedstock/issues/6629
- [x] (HV) Lints/warnings for [`yum_requirements.txt`](https://github.com/search?q=org%3Aconda-forge+path%3Arecipe%2Fyum_requirements.txt&type=code) / CDTs
  - Based on cruft found in above survey, we should IMO warn/error on incorrect entries in `yum_requirements.txt`
  - May even want to go further and warn if `yum_requirements` don't show up as CDTs in meta.yaml (though this would need some metadata [fixes](https://github.com/conda-forge/cdt-builds/issues/72) in our CDTs though)
- [x] (HV) Flang (=windows fortran) [migration](https://conda-forge.org/status/migration/?name=flang19) running, propose to update:
  - write a piggyback migrator (to be written) that switches away from `m2w64_*` compilers (otherwise migration PRs are no-ops) -- [example](https://github.com/conda-forge/lapack-feedstock/pull/74/commits/f472d1aed2b4fedb0a55639d4e0786592da4485e) of the kind of rewrite that would be necessary
  - [exclude](https://github.com/conda-forge/conda-forge-pinning-feedstock/pull/6618) r-feedstocks, as those are consistently on [`m2w64_*` stack](https://github.com/search?type=code&q=org%3Aconda-forge+%2Fcompiler%5C%28%5B%27%22%5Dm2w64_fortran%5B%27%22%5D%5C%29%2F)
- [x] (MRB) Fixed some bugs in the rerender infra. Had to add `--force` to `git add` for the transferred patches.
- [x] (HV) OpenSSL releases reach `host` environments as soon as they are available with a `>=x.y` `run_exports`.
    - xref: https://github.com/conda-forge/conda-forge-pinning-feedstock/pull/6581
    - IF: Package the latest patch version of the last minor when a new minor comes, and then wait a bit til other distros catch up to see what happens with the fresh release.
        - HV: Patch releases usually take longer than a couple weeks, unless there are serious security bugs.
