### Active votes

- [X] JRG: Governance change, vote neded: https://github.com/conda-forge/conda-forge.github.io/pull/2501

### Your __new__() agenda items

- [X] IF: Heads up: m2-* packages were updated today with help from Baz
      Might break things.
        - Moved to rattler-build, 2h recipe takes now 15 min, should make it easier to iterate and update in the future.
        - https://github.com/conda-forge/msys2-recipes to be archived. The feedstock will store the msys2 sources even if they are gone from upstream.

- [X] IF: Need to adjust some recipes (e.g. abi3 ones) so they handle boolean conversion in rattler-build. [Issue](https://github.com/conda-forge/conda-forge.github.io/issues/2514)
- [X] WV: New rattler-build release today, with overlinking checks in Windows too! Other smaller fixes too.
- [X] WV: CEP for sigstore specification in progress thanks to Trail of Bits (same as Homebrew, Rubygems, PyPI). This will allow signatures for conda-forge once standardized.
- [X] WV: Submitted proposal to OpenSSF to help with specifications of sigstore related work and the relevant CEPs needed (e.g. SLSA, counter signing, etc).
