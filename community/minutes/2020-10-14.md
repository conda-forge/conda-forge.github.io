## Agenda

### Standing items

* [x] intros for new folks on the call

* [x] (CJ) budget
    * current approvals?
    * Whenever updated numbers land, please screenshare and show the budget.
        * Link is in Keybase (numfocus_spreadsheets.txt)

#### From previous meeting(s)
* [x] (MvN) Faster provisioning of base build env using conda-lock and micromamba (mm)
    * the tldr: we can get the windows env provisioning overhead down from 5 minutes to 70 seconds 
    * Downsides?
        * Couple of bits that need to land. mm does not support all of the flags we need to install from a conda lock file (currently being worked on by Wolf. should land soonish)
        * (IF) Lockfiles only gives us a few seconds back
    * Advantage
        * Can exactly version the base environment that's used in all of our builds. GH actions-based repo. Every 5 minutes it regenerates the lock file. 
    * Action Items:
        * try out micromamba without locks on win-64
        * 
* [x] (PI) aka - tiny shell subcommand switcher: https://sr.ht/~pi/aka/
    * blog post: https://pirsquared.org/blog/aka.html

### Your __new__() agenda items

* [x] (SG) bloomberg grant stuff
    * Kevin (OSS director) is interested in making a grant to conda-forge. Put together a wishlist of resources that would benefit conda-forge.
        * Resource list, overall estimate
        * Need to establish a wishlist
        * (TODO) Establish a wishlist

* [x] (FF) Push for more testing in the feedstocks. It has been a while that we are using AzurePipelines and the CI limitation reduced significantly. We could start enabling testing by default in the skeleton. This would be the first step towards more auto-merge.
    * TODO: Clarify docs around where we say "don't run tests"

* [ ] (MRB) github releases and conda-forge-sparta

* [ ] (MRB / ED / SC) Roadmap / Funding? Discussion in gitter:
    * (SC) What would CF do as a project if it received funding? Maybe having some kind of whitepapers on the conda-forge website would help. Would conda-forge do something very different if some corporation gave 10k, 100k, or 1M to the project via NumFOCUS? 
        * 10k: does it buy enough hosting to do something interesting? 
        * 100k - what does it bring. 
        * A much larger amount: conda-forge may even be able to have funded people directly working on the project.
        * We can almost certainly find a lot useful stuff that would not hurt getting funding for without necessarily having to get consensus on a roadmap. (something i think would not be controversial, like oh we could use some funding to do some nice web development for better visualization of migrations, or stuff) there are probably a lor of things of that nature.
    * If we make a list, Santa may just show up...
    * see the bloomberg note above...

* [ ] (MvN) tactical things to do about cython?
    * CPython breaks its apis reguarly enough to force a recythoning of much of the python ecosystem.
    * Should we patch our cython so that when the  `CONDA_BUILD` env var is set, we always recythonize and ignore mtime for files?

* [ ] (MvN) noarch: python v2
    * As we increasingly drop compatibility with py27/35/36 should we automatically add python constraints to all `noarch: python` artifacts using repodata pacthing?
        * The idea would be to pick an epoch date (say 2020-10-01) and have the artifacts built after that date get a repodata patch adding a python>=3.6 constraint iff it only had a python constraint.
    
    * Additionally we may as well upate the noarch adding bot action that adds noarch to strip all lines containing py27/34/35 selectors from the recipe.
        * This should allow us to move lots of feedstocks that currently depend on some things only for py27 compat to noarch: python cutting down on the growth rate of artifacts. 

* [x] (IF) CDN down a lot lately
    * (CHL) Anaconda actively looking at the issue; hoping to address it in the next couple weeks

* [ ] (WV) multisheller github.com/wolfv/multisheller

* [x] (CHL) FYI - conda 4.9.0 now on conda-canary; planned release on 19 Oct.

* [cfep-10](https://github.com/conda-forge/conda-forge-enhancement-proposals/pull/15) Feedstock statuses, unmaintained
    * INACTIVE - Merge in with some inactive-esque status?
    * Needs another review. Has unaddressed updates from pkgw as of Jan 11, 2020

    * **UPDATE 2020-07-22**: We in principle have agreement to render the extra pinnings needed directly in the feedstock 
      on a temporary basis (i.e., until the migration has ended).
