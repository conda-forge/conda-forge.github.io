## Agenda

### Standing items

* [x] intros for new folks on the call
    
* [x] (FF) budget
    * current approvals?
    * Whenever updated numbers land, please screenshare and show the budget.

* [x] 2022 Outreachy / GSoC 
    * Ask each week: Any interested parties in owning this?
    * Discussion 2021-11-03
        * If we want to do outreachy again we need a champion - Filipe can't do it next year. Same with GSoC.
        * GSoC is free to us
        * Outreachy costs us $$ ($6500). $6k for student, $500 for admin
        * Some interest from Jannis - he and Filipe will chat about possibly handing off

### From previous meeting(s)

* [x] (CHL): Any updates/improvements needed for anaconda.org? (Context: needed to plan internal development work for 21Q4, 22Q1)
    * Support for `.conda` packages
    * (IF): ability to modify the instructions -- change the "To install this package with conda run one of the following: ..." messages; e.g., squash (default) comments about broken labels.
    * (IF): repodata patches for labels
    * (MRB): faster CDN sync
    * (MRB): support for package signing
    * (CHL): THE MD5 THE!

 
### Your __new__() agenda items

* [x] (WV via ED): Packagingcon recap
    * Interesting talks:
        * lxroot for sandboxing; may be useful for mamba to isolate recipe
        * OCI image registries - would like to support in mamba
        * PubGrub: dart resolver implemented in Rust
            * interested in error messages specifically to see if we can improve error messages in current solver
        * mike sarahan did some rust code in conda (ronda / libronda or something?)
        * homebrew / homebrew linux packaging stack - proposing to homebrew "homebrew meets CF" - maybe they could help us with self-hosted runner questions?
    * MB - major intent was to bring people together from all the different spaces. quite a lot of time we heard from speakers or in the chat was "oh you're doing the same thing" or "oh we should collaborate"
    * TODO: Set up meet-and-greet call with homebrew team?
    * what's the cadence? Idea was to make it again next year but in person. has $50k in the bank (- 30% that numfocus takes). Probably need to start organizing it now.
* [x] (WV): Announcement about repodata signing in https://adelsalle.medium.com/5ce65a27d7d5
    * [ ] Should new core members get a YubiKey? ;)
    * basic plan:
        * anaconda.org needs to get rid of MD5 sums
        * we can have a conda-forge key to sign metadata and repodata to support mirroring
        * isuru: we can't have second class maintainers
        * cheng: need to check potential legal ramifications of signing 
* [x] (WV): cudatoolkit run-depend on __cuda?
    * Can use CONDA_OVERRIDE_CUDA to force install on systems without __cuda available
* [x] (MRB): should we redo the repodata patches at least once a week?
    * I think we have some that continue to apply to new artifacts because of ongoing bugs/changes/issues
        * non-backwards compatible operators in conda-build?
            * https://github.com/conda/ceps/pull/7: add `--compat-level` to optionally remove PEP 440 compatibility operator (`=~`) when running conda-index
        * mpi changes?
        * todo: 
            * make a cron job that runs show_diff.py and posts an issue + commit if it is non-empty
* [x] (WV): Can we get Qt over the finish line?! :pray: 
* [x] (CHL,KO): Updates from Anaconda
    * PR to enable CDN support linux-s390x has been merged
        * https://github.com/conda-forge/conda-forge.github.io/issues/1123
    * Cleaning up permissions from conda GH org and repo
    * Working on GH project/board to enable community triaging


* TODO: Skip mid-december meeting. One more core call at start of december.
