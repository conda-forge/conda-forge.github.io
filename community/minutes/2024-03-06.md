### Pushed to next meeting

- [ ] JRG: [New JSON Schema for conda-forge.yml](https://github.com/conda-forge/conda-smithy/pull/1756) (automated linting + [docs](https://deploy-preview-2095--conda-forge-previews.netlify.app/docs/maintainer/conda_forge_yml/)!)
- [ ] JRG: [New supporters](https://github.com/conda-forge/conda-forge.github.io/pull/2096).
- [ ] DJC: Multi-output and removing static libs from packages as per CFEP-18
    - Have begun opening PRs to remove static libraries and reduce the size of run_exports from packages in my dependency tree by creating soname (shared-library only) outputs
        - examples: libdav1d, libavif, cairo, jpeg-turbo, freetype
    - Tried to streamline / make it easier to craft multi-output recipes using an install script, but it's still clunky and requires too many changes
        - https://gist.github.com/carterbox/188ac74647e703cfa6700b58b076d712
    - Going to try to upstream better support for package splitting to conda-build
        - https://github.com/conda/conda-build/pull/5216
