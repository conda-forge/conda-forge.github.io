### From previous meeting(s)

### Your __new__() agenda items

* (MRB) pybind11 ABI stuff
    * pybind11 is "over pinned" in terms of compiler ABI compat according to the upstream devs
    * we need to remove the compiler abi info from its internal version IDs
    * conda-forge uses pybind11 in two ways:
        1. people use pybind11 w/ the **optional** pybind11-abi package 
            * pybind11-abi helps folks ensure they have a consistent pybind11 ABI in their env
            * it goes in host with pybind11 and has a run export
        2. people use pybind11 without the pybind11-abi package
    * So my question is for which of the two cases above do we want to remove the compiler abi info?
        * certainly case 1
        * I don't see why we wouldn't for case 2
        * Should we be concerned about shipping a patched version of pybind11 relative to upstream? Is that a reason to only do case 1.
    * todo (all MRB)
        * patch compiler activation scripts to append to flags instead of override
            * ^ this has other dangers in terms of not sanitizing the CXXFLAGS
        * patch pybind11-abi to remove compiler dep on abi
        * rebuild packages that depend on pybind11-abi

* (JRG) conda-feedstock tests and [package size](https://github.com/conda-forge/conda-feedstock/issues/158)

* (JL/JRG) conda 4.12.0
    * https://github.com/conda-forge/conda-feedstock/pull/161
    * https://github.com/AnacondaRecipes/conda-feedstock/pull/5
    * currently blocked on defaults packaging the many new dependencies for libmambapy
    * changelog: https://github.com/conda/conda/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#4120-2022-03-08

* (MP) Starting the PyPy 3.8 migration and merging https://github.com/conda-forge/pypy3.6-feedstock/pull/73
    * todo:
        * one migrator for pyp38 and pypy39, depends on python310, will need to do menuinst+ conda + downstreams by hand
        * IF will upload aarch64 and ppc64 builds of the pypy3.6-feedstock (which is misnamed, it builds 3.8 and 3.9) since the CI does not build them, together with the build logs

* (JRG) conda has menuinst + pywin32 deps on windows, but that's only used in `base`
    * We should be able to remove the hard dep from conda
    * And then, add it explicitly in miniforge / miniconda (need to sync with Anaconda)

* (MRB) Travis disabled in conda-smithy for common platforms
    * (IF) Add to conda-forge-ci-setup too

### Active votes

### CFEPs

* [cfep-12](https://github.com/conda-forge/cfep/pull/23) Removing packages that violate the terms of the source package
    * Stalled since May 26, 2020
    * Active debate about moving to "broken" vs deleting from conda-forge channel
    * Active vote, ends on 2020-03-11
