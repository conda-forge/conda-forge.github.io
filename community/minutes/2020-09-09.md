## Agenda

### Standing items

* [x] intros for new folks on the call
    * (MRB) Eli R.

* [x] (CJ) budget
    * current approvals are all up to date.
    * screenshare and show the doc monthly?
        * Link is in Keybase (numfocus_spreadsheets.txt)
    * (MRB) AWS cannot use credits to pay our debts
        * Should we ask Andy to ask them to forgive the debt directly? Ping Brian Grainger too?
            * TODO: Sylvain email Matt Becker to contact Brian Grainger.
            * TODO: Eric pay AWS bill and get reimbursement
        * If we don't do the above, should we pay it off and then join the 
          numfocus org to obtain access to the credits we have?
        * NOTE: Whoever pays the debt will get reimbursement from conda-forge per the 
          vote already passed (plus your credit card points!).

### Your new agenda items
    
* [x] (IF) macOS arm64
    * Cross compiling python recipes.
    ```yaml
    requirements:
      build:
        - cross-python    # [build_platform != target_platform]
        - python          # [build_platform != target_platform]
        - pip             # [build_platform != target_platform]
        - cython          # [build_platform != target_platform]
      host:
        - python
        - pip
        - cython
      run:
        - python
    ```
    * Enabling the CDN for osx-arm64 now that conda-build 3.20.0 is out. (Jonathan is looking at this, might not be this week)
    * How far do you go with the cross-compilation for macos-arm64?
        * conda & conda-build for sure, not sure how much farther
        * Jonathan bootstrapped this problem by building a python env and 
          then building the packages inside of that environment (along the lines of https://github.com/jjhelmus/conda_from_scratch)

* [x] (MRB) Access to DTK from Eli R.
    * a colleague of mine has the chance to get an OSX ARM DTK for testing his scientific software
    * he needs conda/scipy/numpy/etc
    * he is a bit hesitant on making it available to use directly due to this language in the terms:

      >  "Authorized Developers" means Your employees and contractors, members of Your organization 
         or, if You are an educational institution, Your faculty, staff and students, who: (a) have 
         a demonstrable need to know or use the Apple Software or Apple Services in order to develop 
         and test Applications, and (b) to the extent they will access Apple Confidential Information,
         have written and binding agreements with You that prohibit the unauthorized use and disclosure 
         of such confidential information.
    
    * is the language above an issue for anaconda inc access to DTK?
        * Irrelavent; Anaconda, Inc will use its own DTK.
    * discussion items
        1) We clearly want to help and engage on this since scientific users are important!
        2) Do we as conda-forge want to try and get direct access to this for testing our builds?
        3) Could we do this without violating the terms above?
        4) How close are we on the scientific stack?
    * Notes
        * If Eli is willing, have remote access on the CLI to test package builds
        * If we're going to publish packages having been built on the Apple DTK, then need an 
          extremely careful reading of the terms and conditions.
        * Eli's perspective is to type some things locally and submit issues.
        * Cross-compile and then test the cross-compiler?
        * Plans
            * Not engage lawyer (expensive and long)
            * Try and set up weekly / biweekly sync with Eli to help diagnose issues live via Zoom. Post issues to 
            * Absolutely don't publish packages to anaconda.org
            * `conda-build -t` on all mac packages. publish log to somewhere
                * Can we publish logs somewhere? Are created logs confidential because 
                  we created them on the DTK machine?

* [x] (ED) Reminder to vote on https://github.com/conda-forge/cfep/pull/37

* [x] (ED) Computer for Isuru
    * Vote passed (14 :+1:, 1 :-1:)
    * https://github.com/conda-forge/conda-forge.github.io/issues/1150
    * Things to clarify:
        * expectations around usage of machine
        * expectations around making machine available to other members of conda-forge
        * expectations around returning the machine
    * How to actually purchase. Do we have NumFocus credit cards?

* [ ] (MRB) github user @jan-janssen wants to list us in the "affiliated projects" section here https://pyiron.org/collaborators/
    * numfocus trademark guidelines are: "allow most uses as long as it is clear the person using the mark does not appear to be the project or endorsed by the project (without specific permission to do so)"
    * they say ultimately it is up to us
    * are we ok with this user displaying our logo and calling us an "affiliated project"?

* [ ] (MRB) github docker images
    * AFAICT we cannot host public docker images on github unless we let anyone in conda-forge make images and push them
    * quote from docs (https://docs.github.com/en/packages/managing-container-images-with-github-container-registry/configuring-access-control-and-visibility-for-container-images#configuring-visibility-of-container-images-for-an-organization)
        - 'For organization image containers, organizations admins must enable public packages before you can set the visibility to public. For more information, see "Enabling GitHub Container Registry for your organization."'
        - (IF) -  from the docs it looks like we can't control them adding new packages, but we can control who have access to existing packages.
    * I tried pushing an image and could not make it public.
    * thus we need a separate org
    * I propose `conda-forge-docker`

* [ ] (MRB) GCC 9.3.0 migration
    * I want to make sure I understand the list of things to do
    * we've built all of the compilers AFAIK 
    * need to do a direct migration in the bot of the gfortran stack
    * do we want to change the libgfortran libs on linux to have the SO version in the library?
    * What am I missing?

      on a temporary basis (i.e., until the migration has ended).
