### Standing items

- [ ]

### From previous meeting(s)

- [x] JRG: [New JSON Schema for conda-forge.yml](https://github.com/conda-forge/conda-smithy/pull/1756) (automated linting + [docs](https://deploy-preview-2095--conda-forge-previews.netlify.app/docs/maintainer/conda_forge_yml/)!)
    - Deployed seems to be working. May have little tweaks here and there
- [x] JRG: [New supporters](https://github.com/conda-forge/conda-forge.github.io/pull/2096).
  - [Doesn't violate GPDR](https://www.covalentbonds.com/resources/utm-tags-gdpr-data-privacy-codes-made-easy) but still prefer not to have it.
- [X] DJC: Multi-output and removing static libs from packages as per CFEP-18
    - Have begun opening PRs to remove static libraries and reduce the size of run_exports from packages in my dependency tree by creating soname (shared-library only) outputs
        - examples: libdav1d, libavif, cairo, jpeg-turbo, freetype
    - Tried to streamline / make it easier to craft multi-output recipes using an install script, but it's still clunky and requires too many changes
        - https://gist.github.com/carterbox/188ac74647e703cfa6700b58b076d712
    - Going to try to upstream better support for package splitting to conda-build
        - https://github.com/conda/conda-build/pull/5216


### Active votes

### Your `__new__()` agenda items

- [X] JK: CUDA 11.2 Deprecation
  - [x] https://github.com/conda-forge/conda-forge.github.io/pull/2098
- [x] JK: CUDA 11.8 Support
  - Docker image support plan
      - https://gitlab.com/nvidia/container-images/cuda/-/blob/master/doc/container_tags.pdf?ref_type=heads
  - The 550 driver (last driver to support CUDA 11.8) is EOL early next year
  - CUDA 11.8 support would drop off soon after
  - Docker image support plan notes 2 CUDA versions would be supported at a time. So 11.8 would stick around until 13 is added.
  - Would be good to start signaling this soon to users and maintainers
- [x] JK: Close out CUDA 12 migration
  - https://github.com/conda-forge/conda-forge-pinning-feedstock/issues/5390#issuecomment-1986705958
  - Discussed CUDA 12.0 & 12.4 are added in the same PR
      - Provides oldest supported CUDA 12
      - Also asked if add CUDA 12.x latest would be alright to have latest features. Would also save maintainers handling another migration.
- [x] JK: GLIBC 2.28
  - HV: Mainly needs decision about which [CDTs](https://github.com/conda-forge/cdt-builds/issues/66#issuecomment-1833417828) to keep/replace for X11/Gnome/Graphic Stack
      - /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libGLX_indirect.so.0
      - /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libGLX_mesa.so.0
      - /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libGLX_mesa.so.0.0.0
      - /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libGLX_nvidia.so.0
      - /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libGLX_nvidia.so.545.23.08
  - EL 8 has new RPM location (relative to 7). So we need to handle
- [x] JK: Roadmap
    - NF planning to make changes to their funding model to make it possible to recieve work contracts.
    - As part of this it would help if we can build up a wishlist of items that we would like to accomplish
    - JRG: Looked over the old list before. Some were done. Some were in-progress. So may want new list. Still things we could do (as always). Will think about these
    - JK: Would be good if we can all think about what items we would like to do and discuss in a future meeting
    - JRG: Timeline?
    - JK: Long-term change in NF over a few years. So no race. Just starting the process is most helpful. Maybe we can discuss in a future meeting.
    - JRG: Could have a dedicated meeting for this
- [x] HV: Windows Fortran [migration](https://github.com/conda-forge/conda-forge-pinning-feedstock/pull/1359) for flang 18?
  - flang 17 was too experimental, but flang 18 should be stable enough; would solve a bunch of painpoints, e.g. [compilers](https://github.com/conda-forge/compilers-feedstock/issues/58), coin-or [stack](https://github.com/conda-forge/coin-or-cbc-feedstock/issues/3), openblas+openmp on [win](https://github.com/conda-forge/openblas-feedstock/pull/115).
  - Pinning [PR](https://github.com/conda-forge/conda-forge-pinning-feedstock/pull/1359) should be unblocked now that we can use `platform_allowlist:` for migrators (to restrict to windows in this case).
- [x] HV: Stdlib migration announcement ([PR](https://github.com/conda-forge/conda-forge.github.io/pull/2126) / [preview](https://deploy-preview-2126--conda-forge-previews.netlify.app/news/))
  - Will try to start ASAP after conda-build 24.3 is available and last details fixed.
  - May need to rework [this `conda-forge-ci-setup` macOS logic](https://github.com/conda-forge/conda-forge-ci-setup-feedstock/blob/1391177be1b88e7a11df0b824ce6a3e7bcccdb27/recipe/download_osx_sdk.sh)
  - Added to tracking [issue](https://github.com/conda-forge/conda-forge.github.io/issues/2102)
- [x] WV: pixi release (:tada:) - we want to do user interviews if anyone is interested
    - Highlights: tasks that can be skipped, mirrors + OCI registry, bug fixes
