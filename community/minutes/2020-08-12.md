## Attendees
 
## Agenda

### Standing items

* [x] intros for new folks on the call
* [x] (CJ) budget


### Your new agenda items

* [x] (MRB) CFEP-13 and team updates are done

* [x] (CJ) What is the desired UX for abandoned feedstocks? How do we get there?
    * Our current UX is pretty bad, since there is a large disconnect between our users and the maintainance of the feedstocks. This means that many users may not be aware of the feedstock being unmaintained or may be unable to maintain the feedstock themselves. Many users may only find out there is a problem when we don't ship a critical fix or security patch.
    * My proposal is to verify the status of the feedstock and provide our best effort support while not consuming any additional time from our maintainers:
        1. add an issue asking if the feedstock is unmaintianed (if 3 bot version bump PRs haven't been addressed for a month)
            * https://github.com/regro/cf-graph-countyfair/blob/master/status/could_use_help.json
        3. If the issue isn't addressed (closed and bot PRs merged/closed) in a timely manner (a month?) it is considered abandoned
        4. Remove the maintainers and add a caretaker `unmaintained` team. This team's only job is to merge any prs that add maintainers (and remove themselves)
        5. Add a line at the top of the Readme stating that the feedstock is unmaintained and any new maintainers are welcome/encouraged/needed
        6. Add automerge and any other automation that is available at the time (eg. depedency updating)
        7. We can make carve outs for systemicly important packages (eg ruamel.yaml)
    * Need to provide feedback on install to state that the feedstock is unmaintained
    * Add no-maintainer feedstocks (for those who haven't accepted invitations)
    * Don't remove maintainers
    * CVEs? What do we do when a new CVE crops up on a feedstock that is unmaintained? Can we generate a list of these things?
    * Provide 
    * Automerging?
        * R is fine with tightly managed metadata
        * Python, on the other hand, is a mess for dependency resolution. If we add grayskull auto-updating of metadata then most of the concerns around auto-merging are gone.
        * What about other languages?
    * What about packages that are abandoned upstream?
    * Feedstocks with no maintainers is another good place to start
    * https://github.com/conda-forge/cfep/pull/15
    * TODO: Capture the overarching strategy on a hackmd. 
        1. Push through the CFEP on identifying what unmaintained means
        2. ???

* [x] (FF) Pay for Heroku via a NumFOCUS card that will make a direct debit on our funds.
      NumFOCUS (Leah) is also getting in touch with Heroku to see if they can get us some special free stuff.

* [x] (FF) AWS credits: we have 1k and we may get more. We must approve 2 plans, one for what we have and a second one with the extrars that I will ask Andy if we can execute too.
* [x] (IF) Windows server from AWS. This would make debugging windows recipes much easier than debugging on the CI servers.
      Pricing at https://aws.amazon.com/workspaces/pricing/?nc=sn&loc=3
      
* AWS results
    * We are going to make one big request for a lot since that is what is useful.
    * Going to ask for a lot and let them knock it down.
    * Total will be 1600 + cost of windows server
    * use this server: 
        * 8 vCPU, 32 GB Memory	80 GB	50 GB	$130.00	$9.75/month + $1.53/hour

* [x] (IF) macOS arm is under way.
    * Currently blocked by CDN not supporting osx-arm64 downloads
    * Started building python dependencies.
        * zlib - had to guard `make check`
        * bzip2/libffi - worked fine (turned off `test_on_native_only` on libffi because tests are only existence tests)
        * xz/ncurses - had to run autoreconf to get new `config.sub` and `config.guess`
        * ncurses - had to set `BUILD_CC` instead of standard `CC_FOR_BUILD`. (We should probably set that as well)
        * ncurses - Need ncurses from build. https://github.com/conda/conda-build/pull/4011
    * Mini-migrators for some tasks above
        * Guard `make check` with a conditional on `CONDA_BUILD_CROSS_COMPILATION` env variable.
        * Change `cmake .` to `cmake ${CMAKE_ARGS} .`
    * macOS Arm migrator improvements
        * Determine if the source tarball has `config.sub` and `config.guess` and if so replace them with new ones from libtool.
        * If the tests are only existence checks like `test -f`, turn off `test_on_native_only`.

* [x] (CHL) conda 4.8.4 released to "defaults" 2020-08-12; conda-build release coming in next week or two.
* [ ] (AS) qgpu - GPU build agents. 
    * Drone or Azure? Drone is a simple go executable and you can run it in docker. Azure build agent is heavy weight?
    * Pick one and go


### Stuff from last week that we didn't get to

Who is taking these action items?

 * [x] (Paul Martin) Repacking intel MKL from intel instead of Anaconda
     * Unless intel gives us a written doc that gives us permission, 
       we should stick with repackaging
     * https://github.com/conda-forge/intel_repack-feedstock/pulls
     * https://github.com/conda-forge/intel_repack-feedstock/pull/12
     * Action Items:
         * Request input from Intel on their level of comforat among our options for repackaging
         * If they are comfortable with a direct repackage ask for permissions to scrape the version
           numbers as needed by the bot
         * If Intel is comfortable with bot scraping, put up issue to cf-scripts to enable
         * Check back in one month unless things happen sooner

* [x] Dropping python 3.6
    * need an announcement cycle
    * should we follow NEP29? NEP29 + 6 months?
        * https://numpy.org/neps/nep-0029-deprecation_policy.html#drop-schedule
    * End of life for Python 3.x versions:
        * https://devguide.python.org/#status-of-python-branches
    * No pypy for 3.7
        * https://foss.heptapod.net/pypy/pypy/-/wikis/py3.7%20status
    * Action Item: Send to issue (get input from pypy team and others)

      on a temporary basis (i.e., until the migration has ended).
