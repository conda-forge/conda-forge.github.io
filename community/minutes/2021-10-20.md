### From previous meeting(s)
* [x] (CB) NumFocus amendment
    * CB - Not sure if we've ever discussed it, wanted to discuss with core before signing on behalf of core. Not sure what's changed since last time.

### Your __new__() agenda items

* [x] JRG: Quansight GPU queue: conda-forge needs, type of access, stack
    * Last week had chat with OpenTeams (have server installed finally). Saw interface for how to manage server. Want to use OpenStack on bare metal. That's slow, so we're doing VMs on demand. In the process of converting infra to support this. Need to decide which kind of access CF will need. Not entirely clear from our conversation whether we need full admin or just a manager account to set up webhooks or if it's going to be quansight managing on behalf of conda-forge. Need to figure out what CF needs so quansight can accomodate.
    * IF - will want admin access to drone interface, dont need admin on the server. You can make an admin account on drone server so we'll need access to that. Have a new docker image that supports PowerPC. Can they run that instead of the drone image? 
    * JRG - drone server will need to be running 24x7. We have 8 GPUs, 48 cores, not sure about amount of RAM. Potentially can talk about accomodating long builds (e.g., Qt). We will start with GPUs and can potentially expand from there. No time estimates yet - now that we have this we can start talking about CF needs. Do we know if free Drone is enough?
    * IF - Yes, free drone is enough. From the server side, we should allow any CF repo. Two ways to restrict access - from server side and runner side. From server side we need access to all CF repos. Need to be able to register any CF repo in that server. If you want to do restrictions you'll need to do it on the runner side.
    * JRG - That was one of the questions -- what's the allow list for feedstocks? Another question, but can't remember now. TODO: Send out question if/when you remember. Do we need to have per-person accounts or one CF org-wide login. 
    * IF - Personal accounts are fine. On the drone server, the jobs will be public but we can restrict who can create an account in the server itself. Can give conda-forge/core as people that can log in. That way people from CF/core can create an account and log in.
    * MRB - Need to add a bot as an admin on all of the things we're running. We will need to use the Drone API to put secrets into the jobs and everything else. Should add conda-forge-admin.
    * IF - with Drone you dont need to add a bot account - can create a bot account on the drone side. It wont have GUI access but only API access. Then use that bot account to register secrets for jobs.
    * JRG - Drone server can talk to Openstack to spin up VMs? How are the runners going to be created from Drone server? Not clear how runners are going to be spun up yet.
    * https://autoscale.drone.io/install/openstack/
    * JRG - What are the specs we need for the runner VMs?
    * IF - in terms of Drone Server, disk is most important -
        * In terms of the runners, CPU / MEM? 
            * KK - it's very software dependent. Qt doesn't require GPU but it does take a LOT of memory.
        * multi-gpu? 2-gpu things should be done upstream. We just need to know that it works on a single GPU.
            * KK - the way multi-gpu works lots of the time is funky. Sometimes if you build single-gpu then multi-gpu isn't working. If you build with NCCL 
    * https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-github-hosted-runners/about-github-hosted-runners#supported-runners-and-hardware-resources
        * It's worth having more resources than this as some builds (e.g. pytorch) take 10s of hours with this configuration
    * We should present them up front with the desired VMs. 
        * Should carve up the box into 1/8 increments. Then let CF request VMs that are 1/8 or 2/8 of the box. 
    * JRG - Can `drone.conda-forge.org` talk to the Quansight GPU server? (maybe we can avoid licensing costs)
    
* [x] IF: Intel compilers: Pam's suggestions
    * Pam sent an amended version of agreement that we want, is everyone ok with that?
    * IF will forward to Nikolay to get his input

* [x] IF: python 3.10 migration: what to do for aarch64, ppc64le?
    * Travis-CI is down on Sao Paulo workers.
    * Option
        * [ ] drone.conda-forge.org
        * [ ] full emulation
        * [ ] cross compile
            * [ ] PyPy
            * [ ] conda-smithy

    * ED - can we host a public-facing drone server according to the drone license? Yes it's apache2 licensed.

* [x] IF: Ask IBM for ppc64le resources?

* [x] IF: Get https://github.com/conda/conda-build/pull/4287 in before python 3.10 migration
    * IF - Need to rebuild packages because of this PR. Good time to put it in now because of the migration. Rebuilding ~25% of our packages so it's good to get this in before the migration starts. 
    * MRB - any pip-related stuff we need to get into a conda-build release?

* [ ] JRG: `menuinst` CEP https://github.com/conda/ceps/pull/8 (only tangentially related to CF :] )

* [ ] CHL: Any updates/improvements needed for anaconda.org?
    * Support for `.conda` packages
    * (IF): ability to modify the instructions
    * (IF): repodata patches for labels
    * (MRB): faster CDN sync


## Agenda 2021-10-06

* [ ] intros for new folks on the call
    
* [ ] (FF) budget
    * current approvals?
    * Whenever updated numbers land, please screenshare and show the budget.
        * Link is in Keybase (numfocus_spreadsheets.txt)

### From previous meeting(s)

* [ ] (IF) Python 3.10
    * conda issue - https://github.com/conda/conda/issues/10969
    * How to allow older conda users to fail?
        1. Let them find out
        2. Add a `__conda` virtual package and let 
           `python=3.10` package depend on `__conda>=4.10.3`
        3. symbolic link `lib/python3.1` -> `lib/python3.10`
    * TODO New python build that does the symlink (option #3 above)
    * Py3.10-related fixes will be rolled into next conda minor release

* [ ] (CJ via MRB) more reproducible builds?
    * CJ: thinks its pretty close
    * motivated by this blog post: https://hpc.guix.info/blog/2021/09/whats-in-a-package/
    * embed azure build log into the package
    * embed which build system
    * git hash of feedstock?
    * turn off force push to feedstocks
    * need a way to force the build/host/test envs to be the same
    * (IF): see https://github.com/conda/conda-build/issues/2140
    * Possible TODOs
        * store source for builds somewhere
        * store logs for builds somewhere, possibly keyed on package name?
            * And parts of the info.json -- sometimes we have the same filename for different builds
        * store conda-locks of the build/host/test environments
    * Notes
        * transparency vs repeatability vs reproducibility
        * Provenance != reproducibility
        * (Eric) transparency+repeatability > reproducibility
 
 
### Your __new__() agenda items

* [ ] (WV) motivated by conversations on gitter: use more mamba in conda-forge
    * add `mamba install ...` to feedstock readme
    * allow uploads from `mambabuild`
    * road to boa recipes?
    * TODO
        * PR to conda-smithy to add a couple of flags to allow users to enable mamba debug and mamba build&upload

* [ ] (CB) NumFocus amendment

* [ ] (IF) aarch64 builds
    * cloud.drone.io is slow
    * We have $3000 credits from Oracle for a year
        * Enough for 8 runners with 4 vCPUs and 24 GB for a
          year
    * options
        1. host our own drone server/runners
        2. host our own azure agents
        3. cross compile
            - test using qemu
            - pypy builds
        4. emulate
