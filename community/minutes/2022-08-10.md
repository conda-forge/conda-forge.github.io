[2022-06-15](https://hackmd.io/tdkRcPT3QCSkGkABpuKmTg)
* [ ] (MvN) vs2022 compiler support
    * Initial stab at some pieces https://github.com/conda-forge/vc-feedstock/pull/46
    * This is a new VC version
        * Uses existing UCRT
    * Would need to use the windows-2022 github actions image
    * TODO: follow on to change the name of the runtime to vc_runtime
    * TODO: will need patches for msys epoch for UCRT
    * (CHL) For reference: [msys2 environments](https://www.msys2.org/docs/environments/) - pick your own compiler + libstdc++ + Windows runtime adventure 
    * https://www.msys2.org/docs/package-naming/
    * (RG) "we need some version of mingw-w64 for SciPy 1.9.0 too, MSVC + gfortran will no longer work. we use an Rtools toolchain in CI now"
* [ ] (CHL) How does conda-forge use channeldata.json?
    * Only known use by c-f: counting # of package namespaces for "By the numbers" on the webpage; other uses deprecated
    * TODO: CEP to deprecate & remove `--use-channeldata` from `conda-build`
    * TODO: CEP to add run exports to `repodata.json`

[2022-04-05](https://hackmd.io/CqkOlf0XQMOh23Wnmt9qTQ)

* TODO: Articulate suggested mechanism for "so you're thinking about taking a contract to work on conda-forge". tl;dr is you should work on a design doc with the impacted parties (or working groups, or interested folks) on the conda-forge side. Once you have agreement on the scope, delivery timeline, and anything that's needed from the conda-forge volunteer side, go ahead and sign that contract with your payer. if you don't do this first, you may encounter some difficulties finishing delivery of your contractual agreement with your payer.
