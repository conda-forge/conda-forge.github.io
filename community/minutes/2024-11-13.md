### Your `__new__()` agenda items

- [x] (DJC) conda-forge default build containers should always have the latest glibc/sysroot package that we publish
    - https://github.com/conda-forge/conda-forge-pinning-feedstock/issues/6283#issuecomment-2453101928
    - defaulting to the latest os makes os_version irrelevant for most users because glibc backward compatability
    - glibc constraint still set by sysroot package at build time; this package can lag behind syroot in container 
    - (HV) For clarity, I would formulate the topline as: "conda-forge should use the newest available image versions by default (in sync with max sysroot that we publish)"
    - (HV) Fully support this proposal; draft implementation [here](https://github.com/conda-forge/conda-forge-pinning-feedstock/pull/6626)
    - (HV) Also propose to remove `c_stdlib_version` from CUDA zip -- with the policy of "always newest image", this is not necessary anymore (and actually [harmful](https://github.com/conda-forge/conda-forge-pinning-feedstock/pull/6626#issuecomment-2448880229) to common usecases)
    - Additional clarifications:
        - HV: System image mostly irrelevant to the build process, only relevant for runtime constraints that power the `__glibc` virtual package.
        - IF: Ok with proceeding, but should take care of making sure that the cuda-* repackaged stuff still works with the original GLIBC / Docker images. Override in those cases, because those repackaged builds do not use our sysroot, and we can't ensure otherwise that they do work with the lowest Docker image available.
        - HV: consequence would be using `os_version: linux_*: alma8` in `conda-forge.yml` on feedstocks that do binary repackaing
    - Recap: Ok to go, but binary repackaging feedstocks should pin os_version as per above (to stay with whatever minimum version they claim to support) _before_ bumping the default image.
- [x] (HV) Propose to consolidate image names: https://github.com/conda-forge/docker-images/issues/293 
    - IF/CHL: Jinja variables can't be used in `conda_build_config.yaml`
    - use distro-name in the tag (also for CUDA 11.8); despite the lack of templating over it
    - (Some conversations about dropping CUDA 11.8 so the corresponding Docker images are not needed. This will happen eventually, just not yet.)
- [x] (JRG) `conda-forge/miniforge` considered "dangerous site" by Google.
    - See https://github.com/conda-forge/miniforge/issues/667
    - Proposed solution: Move content to conda-forge.org, where we have ownership for reviews and disputes.
    - Thoughts?
        - Consensus: Give it a try.
- [x] (HV) How to deal with [CUDA 12.x](https://github.com/conda-forge/conda-forge-pinning-feedstock/issues/6630)?
