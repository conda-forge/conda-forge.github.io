            * conda-forge has added about 3k feedstocks per year in 2019 and will in 2020
            * the growth in the amount of data we store appears to be accelerating
        2. risk measurements

#### From previous meeting(s)
* [ ] (MB) CentOS 6 end of maintenance support
    * 2020-11-30
      - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centos#End-of-support_schedule
      - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_Hat_Enterprise_Linux#Product_life_cycle
    * Some projects start to use defines from kernels newer than cos6's
      - https://github.com/conda-forge/util-linux-feedstock/pull/7/files#diff-d7075654874cb08007a21aaab3ecd4b3453a9087e7505d034d548b8938b599bcR4-R6
    * (UK) `nodejs` also seems to have dropped cos6: https://github.com/conda-forge/nodejs-feedstock/pull/154
    * (CHL) "defaults" will be dropping CentOS 6 around Jan 2021.


### Your __new__() agenda items

* [x] (JRG) jaime.rogue@gmail.com is interested in helping out with a "conda-forge paper" for JOSS
    * Would be useful for scientists to get citations
    * Two approaches
        * Everyone on core is an author
        * Only people that need
    * Generating something to cite
        * Zenodo? Rolling Zenodo DOIs don't accumulate citations (we need to confirm that.)
        * JRG: As per the [FAQ](https://help.zenodo.org/) _How does DOI versioning work?_, they provide two types of DOIs: version-specific and project-specific. Each project gets at least two: a general one, and then one more for the current version. They are separate DOIs (so different citation "wallets"), _but_ we could ask people to cite the project DOI, and the version specific ones will contain the increasingly growing list of contributors (maybe splitted by time?). For example:
            * Project DOI -> points to https://conda-forge.org/.
                * Author is "The Conda Forge Community".
                * Content of the release: the documentation at that point, or a statement of the mission.
            * Versions: one per year (or other period of time).
                * Each release includes authors that contributed at least one package to conda-forge (new feedstock, new merged PR?). Sorted by amount of contributions. Opt-in via PR label (staged-recipes + PR).
                * Content: whatever is easier to automate. Possibly a list of the newly feedstocks, merged PRs in that timeframe.
        * JRG (cont.): Authors that want credit in their CV can include the Project DOI _and_ the versions that include their contributions, if needed.
    * How do we slice and dice credit? Write a paper and publish it for that specific tool?
    * TODO: Think about bringing in JOSS to provide context around how we might best write papers
    * MRB: I think the community itself should be the sole author.

* [X] CZI proposal results and next steps
    * We got a boilerplate no "good proposal but we got too many" from CZI.
* [x] (CHL) to-dos for osx-arm64 rollout
    * Action item for Anaconda: fix CDN to push osx-arm64 packages
    * Anaconda may add signing to conda-build at some point in expectation that apple will require real certs
      and not simply an ad-hoc signature

### Pushed to next meeting

* [ ] (MB) asking core members to move to "emeritus" status
* [ ] (CJ) We seem to have some artifacts that have more files than expected
    * 4 pkgs ship requests (other than requests itself) see below
    * What should we do about these?
        * Old pkgs
        * Newer/latest pkgs
```

    * **UPDATE 2020-07-22**: We in principle have agreement to render the extra pinnings needed directly in the feedstock
      on a temporary basis (i.e., until the migration has ended).
