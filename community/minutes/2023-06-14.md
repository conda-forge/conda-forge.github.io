### Your __new__() agenda items

- [x] (JK) Summarize recent Linux build outage issue
    - https://github.com/conda-forge/status/issues/144
    - all linux runners were down
    - package on defaults (Anaconda `main`) uploaded to wrong subdir
    - broke libsolv in repodata fetch - so early in jobs that it broke everything
    - discussed with anaconda, they fixed it
    - we removed defaults everywhere
    - how to improve:
        - process on anaconda side
        - [conda-index fix](https://github.com/conda/conda-index/issues/105) to reject bad packages
        - JK: 
            - schema and validation tool for repodata so we can check things
            - more tests!
        - JRG:
            - relax conditions in libsolv that made it barf on this package
            - maybe apply patch to our feedstock of libsolv
        - CHL
            - maybe worth raising how to improve in next week's conda community meeting; e.g., Anaconda customers have long-tail of backwards compatibilty needs (`free` channel still gets used)
        - Wolf: 
            - we can ask if we can roll back this change - maybe change to warning
            - the change: https://github.com/openSUSE/libsolv/blob/2fc0cb31a2010d70f3f9197189730400edbd6ef4/ext/repo_conda.c#L315-L319
- [x] (JK) CUDA 12
    - cuda 12 migrator is going!
    - 30 feedstocks are done
    - changes to commit messaging by Daniel
- [x] (JK) GLIBC 2.28
    - docker image PR working - needs to be merged after addressing comments
    - interesting discussion about [earthly](https://github.com/earthly/earthly) versus Docker for containers.
    - MB Was thinking of making changes to smithy, but will change docker images to alma8 instead
    - (MB) Big lift remaining is to rebuild all the CDTs
- [x] (JK) Windows + ARM
    - Some discussion with MS about CI runners.
    - Jaime will be added to thread
- [x] (JK) Drop some older CUDAs
    - Probably time to drop CUDA 10.2 at least
        - Only [CUDA 11.0+ supported by these data center drivers]( https://docs.nvidia.com/datacenter/tesla/drivers/#cuda-drivers )
    - Docker Support Policy
        - https://gitlab.com/nvidia/container-images/cuda/blob/master/doc/support-policy.md
        - TL;DR some older images are planned for removal soon
    - Have explored this before
        - https://github.com/conda-forge/conda-forge-pinning-feedstock/pull/1708
    - What should the new minimum be?
        - 11.0+ (lower version of 11?)
            - Do we want to keep or drop 11.1 here?
        - 11.2+
            - CUDA Enhanced Compatibility
    - (MvN) Pinged Keith about CUDA 10.2 and he is ok dropping
    - everyone says we should drop 10.2 (JRG to check with openmm and google colab)
       - JRG: Colab is on CUDA 11.8 now! :tada:
       - 
- [x] (HV) Boost unification
   - [PR](https://github.com/conda-forge/boost-feedstock/pull/164) ready, currently aiming at `boost_dev` label until as-of-yet unspecified improvements can be completed
   - Migrator [PR](https://github.com/regro/cf-scripts/pull/1668) exists and should be pretty complete
   - Would like to do this before CPython 3.12 in the fall
- [x] (HV) Windows Fortran [migration](https://github.com/conda-forge/conda-forge-pinning-feedstock/pull/1359)
  - Open since 2 years; fortran-on-win-migratability will be necessary for scipy soon to support meson builds
  - Migrator work that Isuru wanted has been done - can we start?
  - Side benefit: Would [enable](https://github.com/conda-forge/openblas-feedstock/pull/115) openblas+openmp on windows
- [x] (JRG) SDG reports: opt-in CI, conda/schemas
- [x] (WV) ceps for new conda-build YAML schema
    - https://github.com/conda-incubator/ceps/pull/56
    - https://github.com/conda-incubator/ceps/pull/54
- [x] (DPC) [PackagingCon 2023](https://packaging-con.org/) CFP and registration are open
- [x] (DPC) Conda newsletter is coming
    - Anything in particular from conda-forge to highlight?
    - Maybe Asmit's work?
    - CUDA 12
    - Conda-Forge NumFOCUS
    - Look for issues in conda-forge/blog for ideas.
