## Agenda

### Standing items

* [x] intros for new folks on the call

* [x] (CJ) budget
    * current approvals?
    * First meeting of the month, screenshare and show the budget?
        * Link is in Keybase (numfocus_spreadsheets.txt)

### Your new agenda items

* [x] (UK) Kaleido PR
    * https://github.com/conda-forge/staged-recipes/pull/12093
    * Objections
        * Need to inspect dependencies and make sure they're compatible with the rest of CF
        * Should build all of the non-chromium parts in CF
    * dynamically get chromium if it doesn't find it
    * need licenses for all statically linked packages
    * shared libs with libstdc++ symbols might be an issue, check with 'nm â€¦ | grep " T "'
    * (Eric) TODO: Get a call set up with Jon Mease
        * scopatz, wolf, marcel
        * Uwe to comment on issue
        * (Isuru) they're vendoring a lot of libraries in the wheel

* [x] (CJ) Adding information to extras to state what the package provides as import names (for python packages). This will help with future inspection work.
    * https://github.com/regro/cf-scripts/blob/master/conda_forge_tick/pypi_name_mapping.py#L47
    * libcfgraph might have a list of the imports used inside of each library?
        * https://github.com/regro/libcfgraph/blob/master/artifacts/google-cloud-storage/conda-forge/linux-64/google-cloud-storage-1.24.1-py37_1.json
    * valuable to possibly call out who's vendoring what

* [x] (MB) Python 3.9 rc2 (final RC before release?) should be released around these days
    * Has anyone look at this yet? What's to prepare?
    * Final release in about a month
    * (Crystal) Anaconda hasn't gotten to it yet
    * (CJ) When 3.8 appeared, we didn't prep at all. There were about 3-4 weeks of lead time before we were able to produce 3.9 packages
        * This is not true:
            * https://github.com/conda-forge/python-feedstock/pull/258
            * https://github.com/conda-forge/python-feedstock/pull/271
            * https://github.com/conda-forge/python-feedstock/pull/274
    * (Filipe) https://github.com/conda-forge/python-feedstock/issues/270
    * TODO: Should do the simplest thing first: open up a PR and see what fails.
        * Rebase the patches, if the patch doesn't apply then open an issue about it.
        * Semi-related: How do we get our patches into the CPython code base?

* [x] (MRB) @ggarrett13 has some interest in helping with vs2019 transition
    * What do we need to do to get this done?
    * (Isuru) Is this going to be global or just for a few feedstocks?
        * If it's global, that's going to be a bit of a problem. you can link libs with 2017 and 2019 together, but you need 2019 to do the linking. This will require people building conda packages locally to update to vs2019. Uwe was cross-compiling but we only have vs2017. 
    * Which feedstocks need to be updated? Just the vc one
    * new universal runtime which adds new DLLs
        * not on windows 10
        * can download it from windows update
        * make a new runtime package
        * jjhelmus posted a note on the filename in gitter
        * try and use paul's PR for vc for 2019
            * do that PR for 2017 and try it on vc_dev channel
            * then do for 2019
        * keep track of where version numbers come from

#### From last meeting
* [x] (ED) Anything we need to discuss re: computer for Isuru?
    * Going to try the OVH cloud route for now.
    * We've approved this for up to 12 months for now.
    * TODO: Note that future spending proposals should include a TTL

* [ ] (MRB) GCC 9.3.0 migration
    * I want to make sure I understand the list of things to do
    * we've built all of the compilers AFAIK 
    * need to do a direct migration in the bot of the gfortran stack
    * do we want to change the libgfortran libs on linux to have the SO version in the library?
    * What am I missing?

* [x] (MRB) github user @jan-janssen wants to list us in the "affiliated projects" section here https://pyiron.org/collaborators/
    * numfocus trademark guidelines are: "allow most uses as long as it is clear the person using the mark does not appear to be the project or endorsed by the project (without specific permission to do so)"
    * they say ultimately it is up to us
    * are we ok with this user displaying our logo and calling us an "affiliated project"?
        * enthusiastic yes!
    * PR for this: https://github.com/pyiron/pyiron.github.io/pull/77

* [ ] (MRB) github docker images
    * AFAICT we cannot host public docker images on github unless we let anyone in conda-forge make images and push them
    * quote from docs (https://docs.github.com/en/packages/managing-container-images-with-github-container-registry/configuring-access-control-and-visibility-for-container-images#configuring-visibility-of-container-images-for-an-organization)
        - 'For organization image containers, organizations admins must enable public packages before you can set the visibility to public. For more information, see "Enabling GitHub Container Registry for your organization."'
        - (IF) -  from the docs it looks like we can't control them adding new packages, but we can control who have access to existing packages.
    * I tried pushing an image and could not make it public.
    * thus we need a separate org
    * I propose `conda-forge-docker`

      on a temporary basis (i.e., until the migration has ended).
