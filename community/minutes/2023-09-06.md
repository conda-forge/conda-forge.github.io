### Standing items

- [ ]

### From previous meeting(s)

- [ ] (JK) NumPy 2.0 planning
    - https://github.com/conda-forge/conda-forge.github.io/issues/1997
    - https://github.com/conda-forge/conda-forge-repodata-patches-feedstock/issues/516
- [X] (JK) Start using `conda`'s `libmamba` `solver`
    - https://github.com/conda-forge/conda-forge-ci-setup-feedstock/pull/259
    - https://github.com/conda-forge/docker-images/pull/240
    - JRG: 
      - Working on full support for this in conda-smithy. Merged the mambabuild parts already, will proceed with the "install" parts next.
- [ ] (HV) `-dev` vs. `-devel`
  - came up in boost unification, current PR uses the latter based on Isuru's [rationale](https://github.com/conda-forge/boost-feedstock/pull/164#issuecomment-1681583116)
  - matches Anaconda naming & CDTs, does not match recent CUDA feedstocks, tangentially related to distro discussion (RHEL vs. Debian). We should try to choose one.
  - JRG: Our own data:
    - [`-dev` suffix](https://github.com/search?q=repo%3Aconda-forge%2Ffeedstock-outputs+path%3A%22-dev.json%22&type=code): 33 packages
    - [`-devel` suffix](https://github.com/search?q=repo%3Aconda-forge%2Ffeedstock-outputs+path%3A-devel.json&type=code): 10 packages

### Your `__new__()` agenda items

- [ ] (HV) MacOS 10.13, redux
  - Cannot use `recipe_append.yaml` as discussed last call, doesn't work for outputs
  - Since then: [new](https://github.com/conda-forge/staged-recipes/pull/23777) [feedstock](https://github.com/conda-forge/osx-sysroot-feedstock) for "sysroot" on osx & [plan](https://github.com/conda/conda-build/issues/4981) to handle this through new jinja function `{{ stdlib('c') }}` together with cbc-keys for sysroot_impl+version (would also help linux side)
  - This will probably take a while (conda-build, boa, rattler-build, etc., much less rolling out to all feedstocks), and we need an intermediate fix due to already-pressing issues.
- [ ] (HV) Branch deletion policy?
  - I'd [suggest](https://github.com/conda-forge/conda-forge.github.io/issues/1972) to delete dead branches on feedstocks (e.g. long-EOL maintenance branches), and keep history as a git tag on the feedstock. Thoughts?
- [x] (DPC) From the open source director at Posit
    - We are starting to see more requests to add R packages to conda. e.g. https://github.com/tidymodels/tidyclust/issues/167
    - We’re not quite sure how to do this though, and if there’s any sort of social norms around adding your own packages to conda to navigate. Is there guidance you could offer? We’d like to be helpful if we could!
    - Docs: "[Contributing Packages](https://conda-forge.org/docs/maintainer/adding_pkgs.html)"
    - Check all submissions in staged-recipes: https://github.com/conda-forge/staged-recipes/pulls?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Apr+label%3AR
- [x] (CHL) Annoucement: expect a conda release end of September
