### Your __new__() agenda items

- [ ] DG: conda build tools meetings are coming back up: next one Oct 10th. Check with Bianca. See conda community events calendar: https://conda.org/community/calendar
- [ ] WV: rattler-build rollout is going on and [seems to progress nicely](https://github.com/search?type=code&q=org%3Aconda-forge+path%3Arecipe%2Frecipe.yaml). Outstanding items
    - [ ] Version bumping not available yet
    - [ ] Migrator not yet "tested" (going to try to add a package to a osx-arm64 migration soon!)
    - [ ] Experimental cache is already being tried by some multi-output packages
        - [ ] https://github.com/conda-forge/cherab-inversion-feedstock/blob/9aeb59568a2099551ff5e34f433b29a1beb6ee03/recipe/recipe.yaml#L14
    - [ ] Bunch of other issues / shortcomings going to be fixed asap in `rattler-build`
    - [ ] IF: When to move to recipe.yaml in complicated recipes. Would rather wait for compiled things until bugs are fixed.
    - [ ] https://github.com/prefix-dev/rattler-build/issues/955
    - [ ] https://github.com/prefix-dev/rattler-build/issues/952
- [ ] WV: Pixi in CI pipelines
    - [ ] WV: Why mamba update on CI?
        - [ ] IF: Old mamba bug, might be resolved now.
    - [ ] https://github.com/conda-forge/conda-forge.github.io/issues/2323
    - [ ] Marius tried locks and got shot down - see https://github.com/conda-forge/conda-forge-lockfiles
    - [ ] Two separate issues:
        - [ ] performance for bootstrapping: lockfiles?
            - [ ] Action item: measure how long it takes. Might be different across OSs.
        - [ ] local debugging with build-locally.py but with pixi
- [ ] MRB: infrachanges for rerendering / linting / version commands
    - [ ] webservices now sends all jobs that process recipes (except for team updates which only read text) to GHA actions
    - [ ] those GHA jobs run out of conda-forge-webservices actions instead of the actions on repos
    - [ ] isolation of recipes is done using separate GHA jobs (which are separate VMs) and also docker containers
    - [ ] if you see issues bump me
