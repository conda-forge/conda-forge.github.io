### Your __new__() agenda items

- [X] WV: CVE mapping
    - Use PURLs?
    - JRG interested in adding PURLs to. See https://github.com/conda/ceps/pull/114
    - MvN suggests identifying canonical sources
    - UK has been using automated scan tools to identify CVEs in Go packages
        - MvN: approach tricky for C/C++, probably better for Rust because they contain enough metadata
    - MvN Integrated command could be interested to launch the analysis upon env creation
        - UK: these analysis are costly though, in the order of minutes
        - UK: Run them on cronjobs on top of small number of known lockfiles
        - UK: These analysis lead to discovery of weird dependencies in the tree (terraform > openai > weights and biases)
    - UK expressed concerns about Dependabot and Github analysis creating noise with false positives
- [x] DJC: CI restart behavior has changed?
    - DJC Close and reopen PRs do not retrigger the CI.
    - IF no changes, just flaky Azure.
- [X] WV: Latest tinyxml release was ABI incompatible and broke a few packages. More tests?
    - DJC: ABI laboratory dead, but tools appear to have moved to the "Linux Hardware Project". Packaged in conda-forge now.
        - DJC: https://github.com/lvc/abi-dumper
    - WV: Could a tool run the ABILaboratory logic to detect ABI breakage across releases?
        - MvN: Create two envs with release and release-1 and diff the results?
        - DJC: Library has two methods available: compile with debug symbols, or binary+headers.
        - UK: Probably because they also show symbol renames, not just ABI incompatibilities. Might just work for us to run the ABI checks only.
    - IF: We should just pull tinyxml2 10.1 version, 11.0 is available
        - WV: Agreed for this particular problem
 - [X] WV: conda-forge 10th anniversary soon right?
    - JRG: Apr 11th. Let's do something fun about it! At the very least a blog post.
