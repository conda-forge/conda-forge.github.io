* [ ] (IF) Cross compiling python recipes.
    ```yaml
    requirements:
      build:
        - cross-python    # [build_platform != target_platform]
        - python          # [build_platform != target_platform]
        - pip             # [build_platform != target_platform]

    * Looking at next major version release; ~2020-Q4 or 2020-Q1

      on a temporary basis (i.e., until the migration has ended).
