### Your __new__() agenda items

- [X] (JK) Conda-build 24.5.0
    - Now released. Small [hiccups](https://github.com/conda-forge/status/issues/177) in conda-forge-ci-setup with deprecated code that was already cleared up.
        - https://github.com/conda-forge/conda-forge-ci-setup-feedstock/issues/317
    - Watch for `conda_build.config.subdir` imports and similar lines.
    - Could we add some testing with Conda Canary or make the warnings more visible
        - Perhaps https://github.com/conda-forge/cf-autotick-bot-test-package-feedstock
        - https://github.com/conda-forge/conda-smithy/issues/1881
- [X] Fundable tasks
    - https://github.com/conda-forge/conda-forge.github.io/issues/2172
    - Hard to build a long list of items in HackMD or similar
    - Could we track this list on GH directly by labeling issues or similar
    - Looking for feedback/discussion on this issue
    - Would be nice to have this ready when someone shows up with a checkbook :)
    - PSF uses this approach: https://github.com/psf/fundable-packaging-improvements
    - Could either centralize to webpage repo (maybe with stub issues) or decentralize by just adding labels on repo issues where needed
    - How to discover?
        - Ideally want a link to find them all
- [X] (JK) GLIBC 2.28
    - (JK) CDT list ready?
        - https://github.com/conda-forge/cdt-builds/issues/66
        - (IF) What to do with the ones with the `?`
            - (HV) Could build them for safety
            - (IF) Should we wait until they are requested
                - (HV) Concern that this could be fairly slow process
                    - (HV) Might make it slow to upgrade
                    - (IF) Would like to reduce these on the outset
        - (HV) Can we review `libglvnd`?
            - https://github.com/conda-forge/staged-recipes/pull/25919
        - (IF) Licenses (bug?) in https://github.com/conda-forge/cdt-builds? Couldn't find them
            -  (MRB) May be a bug
        - Items marked with green checks at https://github.com/conda-forge/cdt-builds/issues/66#issuecomment-1833417828 can be part of the new rebuilds
    - IF: Let's not add cos8 to the cdt_name, let's just use 'conda' to get rid of `cdt_name` in the pinnings and so.
        - (JK) Noted in issue: https://github.com/conda-forge/conda-forge.github.io/issues/1941
        - (HV) Compilers already account for this
        - (MRB) sysroot repodata hack can be dropped
- [X] (JK) NumPy 2
  - (HV) Currently best [option](https://github.com/conda-forge/conda-forge-pinning-feedstock/pull/5851#issuecomment-2111433502) seems to "soft-close" 3.12 migration; avoids a lot of PR churn, but keeps status page and bot running.
      - Adding NumPy 2.0 bump in Python 3.12 migrator would break that migrator
      - Build with Python 3.12 (lots of churn)
      - (Soft-)Close Python 3.12
          - Def of Soft
              - Apply migration to global pinnings
              - Keep migrator open
              - Benefit is tracking status of migrator
          - (MRB) In favor of soft-closing
          - (HV) Have typical run until the end
          - (MB) Time a migrator stays open is not defined anywhere, so it's ok to override the "normal time other migrators have stayed open"
      - (IF) Possible technical solution. Is there a key ignore option?
          - (MRB) It is undocumented
              - (MRB) [`override_cbc_keys`](https://github.com/regro/cf-scripts/blob/master/conda_forge_tick/make_migrators.py#L387)
              - (MRB) Allows to override what keys are used from `conda-build-config`
              - (MRB) Link: https://github.com/regro/cf-scripts/blob/master/conda_forge_tick/make_migrators.py#L387
      - Consensus is soft-closing Python 3.12 migration to unblock NumPy 2
          - (MB) Recommend adding a note that is a pragmatic decision. Not based on a subset of the community's recommendation
- [X] (JK) CUDA ppc64le support
  - https://github.com/conda-forge/cuda-feedstock/issues/27
  - Noted in CUDA 12.4 next release won't have ppc64le support in CTK
  - Still building with CUDA 12.0 in conda-forge, which still has ppc64le support
  - Also existing packages through CUDA 12.4 are still available
- [X] (HV) NumPy [considering](https://github.com/numpy/numpy/pull/26430#issuecomment-2108839048) to move to VS2022 baseline
  - Probably far-reaching enough that we'd have to upgrade too
  - VS2019 is EOL since a few weeks, but not yet being removed from various CI providers 
      - JRG: Azure has no mentions of future vs2019 deprecations at https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/pipelines/agents/hosted?view=azure-devops&tabs=yaml
- [x] (WV) Neighbourhoodie SOW accepted :tada: 
- [x] (WV / NM) rattler-build support in conda-smithy
    - https://github.com/conda-forge/conda-smithy/pull/1876
    - Any questions?
    - (MRB) reviewing currently :)
    - (WV) Label handling
        - (IF) Handled in conda-forge-ci-setup
        - (IF) Please send a PR :)
- [X] (MRB) lots of recent bot work
  - bot now carefully uses docker containers for isolation of recipe / user code from bot info for most steps
  - migrations as objects can now be serialized to JSON
  - documentation has moved to the README in the bot repo (no more GH pages, all links should be updated)
  - cleaned out old code, env vars, etc.
  - logs should be a lot easier to parse now
- [ ] (IF) Mingw support
    - Cross compiler works now (`host=linux-64` -> `target=win-64`)
    - Need native compiler to work (`host=win-64` -> `target=win-64`)
    - Needed for R builds
        - https://github.com/conda-forge/ctng-compilers-feedstock/pull/134
        - Building this with `build=linux-64`. conda-build has issues here https://github.com/conda/conda-build/issues/5341
        - conda-libmamba-solver also has to fix some things
