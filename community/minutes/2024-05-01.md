### Your `__new__()` agenda items

- [X] (HV) Numpy 2.0 migration
  - Now following the same approach as the python 3.12rc migration, using a `_numpy_rc` package.
      - https://github.com/conda-forge/conda-forge-pinning-feedstock/pull/5790
  - Should be ready to go once [this](https://github.com/conda-forge/numpy-feedstock/pull/314) is merged.
- [X] (HV) Discuss how we might want to follow Diátaxis in the docs, and whether we can agree on a rough [outline](https://github.com/conda-forge/conda-forge.github.io/issues/2164) of how such a website (re)structure would look like
- [x] (JK) Drop CUDA 11.2
    - Agreed to drop CUDA 11.2
- [x] (JK) Finishing CUDA 12 migration
   - https://github.com/conda-forge/conda-forge-pinning-feedstock/pull/5613 
   - Discussed CUDA 12.0 & 12.x with x as max
       - CI usage
           - Most jobs have 11.2 & 12.0 (through migrator) now. So dropping 11.2 and adding 12.x should be roughly the same usage
   - Decided to keep discussing in the PR
- [x] (JK) GLIBC 2.28
    - Do we have the CDTs we need listed?
        - https://github.com/conda-forge/cdt-builds/issues/66
    - Would like to add libglvnd
        - https://github.com/conda-forge/staged-recipes/pull/25919
    - Otherwise this list looks good
- [ ] (HV) Bump `c_stdlib_version` to 10.13 on macOS in global pinning
  - In a previous core call we agreed that a linter rule warning about missing `{{ stdlib("c") }}` should be enough to deal with feedstocks that haven't been touched by the piggyback yet.
  - The linter rule is now live as of conda-smithy 3.35.
- [ ] (WV) CEPs: Sharded (faster) repodata & OCI registry
    - [ ] https://github.com/conda-incubator/ceps/pull/75
    - [ ] https://github.com/conda-incubator/ceps/pull/70
- [X] (WV) Bigger Windows runners - prefix would like to sponsor if possible
    - [ ] JRG: Related (I think): https://github.com/Quansight/open-gpu-server/issues/31
        - [ ] Jaime to compile a list of items for adding a Windows runner to Cirun + admin-requests.
    - [ ] Pytorch compilation. Maybe cross compile from Linux?
        - [ ] https://github.com/conda-forge/clang-win-activation-feedstock/blob/main/recipe/meta.yaml
        - [ ] Would need SDK download instead of relying on the underlying VM.
        - [ ] Also, last time this came up, Uwe [warned](https://github.com/conda-forge/admin-requests/pull/949#issuecomment-1963416546) of a "major conda-build bug" with this. I (HV) don't have further context/references than that.
- [X] (SC) Year 2 contract for CZI grant
