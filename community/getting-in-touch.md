# Getting in Touch

The community at conda-forge would be happy to connect with you. We have got several ways for you to communicate with us, primarily through issue trackers, mailing lists, and real-time chat.

## Issue Trackers

The main issue trackers that you will interact with are

* [staged-recipes](https://github.com/conda-forge/staged-recipes/issues): You'll use staged-recipes to create a new conda package on conda-forge
* [Our main website repo](https://github.com/conda-forge/conda-forge.github.io/issues): You'll use this repo as a catch-all for issues where you're not sure where else to put them
* [Our enhancement proposals repo](https://github.com/conda-forge/cfep/issues): You'll use the enhancement proposals repo if you're interested in substantially changing the way conda-forge operates.

## Gitter and Element

The main chat rooms that you'll interact with are

* [gitter: general](https://gitter.im/conda-forge/conda-forge.github.io): Our general chat room for all things conda-forge. Pretty much any question can be asked here and others in the community may be able to help.
  Move stuff to an issue tracker if your question isn't getting resolved.
* [gitter: core/private](https://gitter.im/conda-forge/core): Private chat for the @conda-forge/core team to discuss continued operations and improvements to conda-forge.
* [gitter: power pc](https://gitter.im/conda-forge-ppc64le/Lobby): Public chat room for all things related to building for power pc (IBM) systems.
* [gitter: bot subteam](https://gitter.im/conda-forge/regro-cf-autotick-bot): Public chat room for all things related to the conda-forge automation infrastructure.
  Our automation infrastructure is colloquially referred to as "the bot".
* [gitter: compilers](https://gitter.im/conda-forge/conda-forge-compilers): Public chat room focused on the conda-forge compiler stack.
* [element: conda-forge-space](https://app.element.io/#/room/#conda-forge-space:matrix.org): An element space listing all conda-forge rooms.
* [element: interns](https://app.element.io/#/room/#conda-forge_conda-forge-interns:gitter.im): Public chat room for conda-forge interns to discuss projects and seek guidance from the community.
* [element: general](https://app.element.io/#/room/#conda-forge:matrix.org): Public chat room for the conda-forge community to discuss anything related to conda-forge.
