# Contracting Information

If you are interested in a contractual engagement to solve a specific problem that you're facing, this page details the kinds of services that are available to you. conda-forge, as an entity, does not have the ability to engage in a contractual arrangement as of now.
However, there are a number of community members that you may engage with.
conda-forge does not endorse anyone (individuals or companies) listed on this page.

If you are interested in a service that is not listed on this page, please reach out to us on our [issue tracker](https://github.com/conda-forge/conda-forge.github.io/issues), on  [Element](https://app.element.io/#/room/#conda-forge:matrix.org)  or via emailing the core team directly at [conda-forge-core@googlegroups.com](mailto:conda-forge-core@googlegroups.com) and we will help to circulate your request more broadly within the community.

Our intent with this page is to communicate whom you should contact and negotiate a contract with.
We hold no liability for the outcome of those negotiations or the results of any work that is done under those terms.
We will not arbitrate any contract disputes.
That is between the payer and payee to hammer out on their own.
