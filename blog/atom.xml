This decision does <em>not</em> impact R packages in conda-forge, which continue to be available without any changes.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://github.com/conda-forge/r-feedstock/blob/7de3342693b3e1e98c2461d5385d8ebcce6b04db/recipe/meta.yaml#L30-L40" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class=""><code>@conda-forge/r</code> team</a> currently maintains <a href="https://github.com/search?type=code&amp;q=org%3Aconda-forge+%22-+conda-forge%2Fr%22+path%3Arecipe%2F" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="">4.4K+ feedstocks</a> for the two latest minor R releases, and will continue to do so. At the time of writing, these are R 4.5 and R 4.4. Older versions are still available but won't receive any updates or rebuilds. When R 4.6 is released, 4.5 will still be maintained and 4.4 will stop receiving updates, and so on.</p>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[With yesterday's release of Python 3.14, we not only have Python 3.14 itself available on conda-forge,]]></summary>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>With yesterday's <a href="https://pythoninsider.blogspot.com/2025/10/python-3140-final-is-here.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="">release of Python 3.14</a>, we not only have Python 3.14 itself available on conda-forge,
but also a wide selection of packages to make use of it.
As the conda ecosystem is based on binary packages, this means that several packages are already built for Python 3.14.</p>
<p>You can create a new environment by using:</p>
<div class="language-text codeBlockContainer_Ckt0 theme-code-block" style="--prism-color:#393A34;--prism-background-color:#f6f8fa"><div class="codeBlockContent_QJqH"><pre tabindex="0" class="prism-code language-text codeBlock_bY9V thin-scrollbar" style="color:#393A34;background-color:#f6f8fa"><code class="codeBlockLines_e6Vv"><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain">conda create -n py314 python=3.14 -c conda-forge</span><br></span></code></pre></div></div>
<p>At the time of writing, the <a href="https://conda-forge.org/status/migration/?name=python314" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="">Python 3.14 migration is 77% progressed</a>. This means that:</p>
<ul>
<li class="">1273 (41%) packages that needed a rebuild were built for Python 3.14</li>
<li class="">1115 (36%) have an open PR to get rebuilt for Python 3.14</li>
<li class="">704 (23%) packages are still waiting for a dependency to be rebuilt.</li>
</ul>
<h2 class="anchor anchorTargetStickyNavbar_Vzrq" id="what-is-already-usable">What is already usable?<a href="https://conda-forge.org/blog/2025/10/09/python-314/#what-is-already-usable" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to What is already usable?" title="Direct link to What is already usable?" translate="no">​</a></h2>
<p>While most binary packages needed to be rebuilt for Python 3.14,
we did not need to rebuild packages that are <code>abi3</code>-compatible.
Here, you can use the builds that were done with previous Python versions.
Similarly, all pure Python packages (i.e. the ones we call <code>noarch: python</code> in the conda world) didn't need to be rebuilt and can be used directly.</p>
<p>Still, as the statistics above show, not all packages are available for Python 3.14 yet.
The most prominent here include <code>pytorch</code>, <code>numba</code>, and <code>cytoolz</code>.
For the latter two, we need to wait for them to provide new releases that make them compatible with 3.14.
In the case of PyTorch, we either need to wait for the new <code>2.10.0</code> release or may be able to backport changes to the <code>2.9.0</code> release.
You can track the progress on the upstream side in <a href="https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/issues/156856" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="">pytorch#156856</a> and on the conda-forge side in <a href="https://github.com/conda-forge/pytorch-cpu-feedstock/pull/420" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="">pytorch-cpu-feedstock#420</a>.
For <code>numba</code>, we expect the necessary changes to land in <code>0.63</code>.
As a there is already <a href="https://github.com/numba/numba/releases/tag/0.63.0b1" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="">a beta</a> available, we will wait here for the final release and won't backport any changes.
For other packages, similar approaches will be taken.
You can track the progress for each of them if you click on <a href="https://conda-forge.org/status/migration/?name=python314" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="">the respective link on the status page</a>.</p>
<p>If you face any issue with the Python package itself, please report that on the <a href="https://github.com/conda-forge/python-feedstock/issues" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="">python-feedstock</a>.
For problems with individual packages, please do so on the respective <code>conda-forge/&lt;package&gt;-feedstock</code> repository.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorTargetStickyNavbar_Vzrq" id="how-was-conda-forge-able-to-provide-release-day-availability">How was conda-forge able to provide release day availability?<a href="https://conda-forge.org/blog/2025/10/09/python-314/#how-was-conda-forge-able-to-provide-release-day-availability" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to How was conda-forge able to provide release day availability?" title="Direct link to How was conda-forge able to provide release day availability?" translate="no">​</a></h2>
<p>Like we already did in the releases for <a href="https://conda-forge.org/blog/2024/09/26/python-313/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="">Python 3.13</a> and <a href="https://conda-forge.org/news/2023/09/25/python-312-migration-and-python-311-by-default/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="">Python 3.12</a>, we have started building packages for Python 3.14 once the release candidate was available.
As ABI-stability is guaranteed between release candidates, these packages are also usable with the final Python release.
Thus, we were able to start building packages for this release already on <a href="https://github.com/conda-forge/conda-forge-pinning-feedstock/pull/7598" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="">August 20</a>.
Unfortunately, as part of this release process, the <a href="https://discuss.python.org/t/python-3-14-0rc3-is-go/103815" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="">magic number stored in Python bytecode (<code>.pyc</code>) was bumped</a> in RC2 and RC3.
This means that the bytecode will be regenerated on the first run for packages built with a version earlier than RC3.
As the impact of this has been minor, we did not rebuild the respective packages and expect that through package updates, this will quickly become unnoticeable.</p>
<p>Note that the current migration only includes the "default" flavour of Python.
We have not yet started building packages for the <code>freethreading</code> version.
Once work on making the migrator more selective has progressed, we will start to build packages.</p>]]></content>

<p>Back in April 2024, we started a conversation with <a href="https://ostif.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="">OSTIF</a> that would result in a partnership with <a href="https://7asecurity.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="">7ASecurity</a>. The security audit took part from February to May, where 7ASecurity reported all their findings. The <code>conda-forge/core</code> team assessed the reports and submitted the necessary fixes to our infrastructure and involved tooling, from which we highlight:</p>
<ul>
<li class="">Three incidents in <code>conda/conda-build</code>.</li>
<li class="">Two incidents in <code>conda-forge/conda-forge-webservices</code>.</li>
<li class="">Two incidents in <code>conda-forge/conda-smithy</code>.</li>
<li class="">One incident in <code>conda/constructor</code>.</li>
<li class="">One incident in <code>conda-forge/conda-forge-ci-setup</code>.</li>
<li class="">One incident in <code>conda-forge/infrastructure</code>.</li>
</ul>
<p>7ASecurity also contributed a detailed threat model and a supply chain security analysis. CVEs, Github Advisories and related contributions are available in the <a href="https://conda-forge.org/_static/CON-01-conda-forge-Audit-Public_RC1.0.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="">final report</a>.</p>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>In the past few months, <code>conda-forge</code> has been engaging with an external security audit in collaboration with
the <a href="https://ostif.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="">Open Source Technology Improvement Fund</a> (OSTIF). The full results of this audit will be
made public once it is complete per OSTIF responsible disclosure policies.</p>
<p>During this process, OSTIF and their contractor uncovered misconfigured infrastructure which exposed the <code>anaconda.org</code>
token for the <code>conda-forge</code> channel to all feedstock maintainers. The token was exposed from on or about 2025-02-10 through
2025-04-01. See our <a href="https://github.com/conda-forge/infrastructure/security/advisories/GHSA-m4h2-49xf-vq72" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="">GitHub Security Advisory</a>
for more details.</p>
<p>We have requested a CVE from GitHub and will amend this announcement once it is issued. Our response to this
incident is detailed below, but TL;DR, as best as can reasonably be determined, <strong>no packages were compromised
during this time</strong>.</p>
<p>Thank you for using <code>conda-forge</code>, please <a href="https://conda-forge.org/community/getting-in-touch/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="">contact us</a> if you
have further questions, and please follow our <a href="https://github.com/conda-forge/conda-forge.github.io/blob/main/SECURITY.md" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="">security process</a>
for responsible reporting of vulnerabilities.</p>
<p><strong>Finally, as a reminder, <code>conda-forge</code> packages are built by strangers on the internet (our wonderful feedstock
maintainers!) and are not suitable for use cases that require secure software provenance.</strong></p>

<p>The timeline and details of our response to this security incident are as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li class="">2025-04-01 13:35 UTC: OSTIF and their contractor notified <code>conda-forge</code> of the leaked token.</li>
<li class="">2025-04-01 14:00 UTC: The <code>conda-forge/core</code> team acknowledged receipt of the report and
started conducting the investigation.</li>
<li class="">2025-04-01 14:15 UTC: The <code>conda-forge/core</code> team disabled the token and stopped uploads to <code>anaconda.org</code>.</li>
<li class="">2025-04-01 14:20 UTC: We posted an <a href="https://github.com/conda-forge/status/issues/194" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="">incident</a>
to our status page reporting that uploads were temporarily paused.</li>
<li class="">2025-04-01 15:19 UTC: We audited all uploads to the <code>conda-forge</code> channel, looking for uploads that
bypassed our upload staging process. We did not find any. This check is not completely robust, but it
does indicate that nothing was obviously compromised.</li>
<li class="">2025-04-01 15:53 UTC: We decided to delay disclosure by one day to 2025-04-02 in order to not generate
confusion (2025-04-01 is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/April_Fools%27_Day" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="">April Fools' Day</a> in some countries
when people commonly engage in practical jokes).</li>
<li class="">2025-04-01 21:39 UTC: We deployed a fix to our infrastructure.</li>
<li class="">2025-04-01 22:20 UTC: We then deployed a new token to our infrastructure and restarted uploads.</li>
<li class="">2025-04-01 23:02 UTC: The status page <a href="https://github.com/conda-forge/status/issues/194" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="">incident</a> was marked as resolved.</li>
<li class="">2025-04-02: We published this announcement and the advisory. GitHub produced CVE-2025-31484 for us based on our security advisory.</li>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The conda-forge team is excited to announce that the v1 recipe format is available on conda-forge. The v1 recipe format is a community initiative dating back over 3 years to improve the recipe format for conda packages. If you are a maintainer of a feedstock on conda-forge, you have probably dealt with <code>meta.yaml</code> files that conda-build utilizes. The file format has some limitations which is why the community has come together to come up with an improved version of the format: the v1 format.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorTargetStickyNavbar_Vzrq" id="rattler-build-and-the-v1-spec">rattler-build and the v1 spec<a href="https://conda-forge.org/blog/2025/02/27/conda-forge-v1-recipe-support/#rattler-build-and-the-v1-spec" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to rattler-build and the v1 spec" title="Direct link to rattler-build and the v1 spec" translate="no">​</a></h2>
<p>The v1 recipe format has a number of benefits:</p>
<ul>
<li class="">It always parses as valid YAML which makes it much easier to modify it with the bot infrastructure of conda-forge. While meta.yaml looks like YAML, it can contain Jinja logic that is incompatible with the YAML specification, which significantly complicates parsing and automated manipulation. Additionally, the new recipe format has <a href="https://github.com/prefix-dev/recipe-format/blob/main/schema.json" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="">a published JSON schema</a> which means that the editing experience in VS Code is greatly improved with contextual help.</li>
<li class="">The new recipe format enables much faster builds due to design decisions that eliminate the need for recursive parsing.</li>
<li class="">Some features of conda-build, such as multiple outputs, had a lot of implicit behavior. We are fixing that in the v1 recipe.</li>
</ul>
<p>conda-forge uses rattler-build as its default build tool for the v1 recipe format. rattler-build currently has some significant benefits:</p>
<ul>
<li class="">rattler-build is built on top of rattler, a modern re-implementation of the conda standards in Rust, enabling extremely fast recipe builds.</li>
<li class="">The log output of rattler-build is greatly improved, always showing the user what the final files in the package are and the final metadata.</li>
</ul>
<p>You can read much more about the v1 recipe format in the <a href="https://rattler.build/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="">https://rattler.build</a> docs and the two CEPs <a href="https://github.com/conda/ceps/blob/main/cep-0013.md" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="">CEP-0013</a> and <a href="https://github.com/conda/ceps/blob/main/cep-0014.md" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="">CEP-0014</a>. With the new format comes also a new build tool called <a href="https://github.com/prefix-dev/rattler-build" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class=""><code>rattler-build</code></a> which is developed by <a href="https://prefix.dev/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class=""><code>prefix.dev</code></a>. It is a reimplementation of conda-build in Rust, on top of the <a href="https://github.com/conda/rattler" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class=""><code>rattler</code></a> libraries.</p>
<p>A simple v1 recipe looks something like the following:</p>

<p>If you are adding a new recipe on staged-recipes, then it's easy: just submit a <code>recipe.yaml</code> file instead of a <code>meta.yaml</code> file.
In case you already maintain a feedstock, then the conversion can be semi-automated with a tool created by <a href="https://github.com/hadim" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="">Hadrien Mary</a> called <a href="https://github.com/hadim/feedrattler" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class=""><code>feedrattler</code></a>. The tool will take care of the basic conversions steps and uses <a href="https://github.com/conda-incubator/conda-recipe-manager" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class=""><code>conda-recipe-manager</code></a> by Anaconda / <a href="https://github.com/schuylermartin45" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="">Schuyler Martin</a> under the hood to parse the recipe and convert it to the new format.</p>

<p>To do the conversion by hand, you need to do the following things:</p>
<ul>
<li class="">In the feedstock's <code>conda-forge.yml</code>, add <code>conda_build_tool: rattler-build</code></li>
<li class="">Remove the <code>meta.yaml</code> file and add a <code>recipe.yaml</code> file following the v1 spec</li>

<p>For the foreseeable future, conda-forge is going to support both formats, v1 and v0. We envision a gradual transition over at least one year to the new spec. There are a couple of places where the v1 spec also needs to finalize / stabilize. One notable place is the <code>cache</code>-based multi-output feature, where CEP discussions are ongoing. This stabilization in the format should happen within Q1 of 2025.</p>
<p>Since the beginning of 2025, the bot has gained more capabilities for the v1 format, such as automatically bumping versions (the "autotick-bot"). There are a number of other migrators and mini-migrators that need to be fully ported to the v1 spec before we can claim 100% compatibility with the conda-forge infrastructure.</p>
<p>As of today, over 700 of the 25000 recipes on conda-forge have been converted.</p>
<p>For now, the recommendation on staged-recipes is: if it's a simple <code>noarch: python</code> recipe, it should probably be a <code>v1</code> recipe. The same goes for <code>Rust</code> or <code>Go</code> projects that have a simple structure.</p>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>We introduce noarch variants for python packages on conda-forge
that have compiled extensions but with pure python reference
implementations to make life easier for early adopters of
new python variants.</p>
<p>conda-forge packages have always been batteries included. When
a package has some build options turned off by default to reduce
dependencies, we have enabled these options to give the most
functionality and performance to our users.</p>
<p>In the Python world, some packages are written in C/C++/Cython
to get the most performance out of a package. However these packages
sometimes have a reference implementation written in Python. The Python
reference implementation is a good way to check the C/C++/Cython
code against a much simpler python implementation and is also
useful for platforms like PyPy where the C/C++/Cython implementation
can be slower than the Python reference implementation due to the
emulation of the Python C/C++ API by PyPy. For example for the Cython
package, setting the <code>CYTHON_NO_COMPILE</code> environment variable
when building the Cython wheel itself, it will use the Python reference
implementation. The only way to figure out if a package has a Python
reference implementation is to look at the library's source code
to see if <code>extensions</code> are optional.</p>
<p>To support platforms like PyPy, some packages build wheels with
compiled extensions for the platforms that are
known to be more performant with the compiled extension, but also
provide a universal pure Python wheel for the other platforms.
This also provides a way for new Python versions and variants
like the free-threading Python build to use these packages by the
early adopters of these Python versions.</p>
<p>On conda-forge we usually have compiled Python packages, but provide
no reference implementation. This means early adopters of new Python
versions need to wait for the conda-forge bot managed by @conda-forge/bot
team to start the migration and rebuild the packages. For example the
free-threading Python 3.13 build is still paused as
conda-forge has decided to focus on the default (GIL enabled)
Python 3.13 build first while upstream packages work on
supporting free-threading.
Another issue is that some packages have cyclic dependencies at build
or test time and this requires some manual handling.</p>
<p>We have been adding <code>noarch: python</code> variants for some feedstocks
so that the compiled extension has higher priority and the pure
Python extension has lower priority, which makes the conda solver
use the <code>noarch: python</code> variant if no suitable compiled variant
is available. One issue is that the linter might not like selectors
on noarch recipes. We added an option</p>

<p>We build the two variants using a <code>recipe/conda_build_config.yaml</code>
with the contents,</p>

<p>Finally in the build script, we use the env variable <code>use_noarch</code>
to set an option to force the extension to be pure python.

        <updated>2024-09-26T00:00:00.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[conda-forge now supports Python 3.13 on conda.]]></summary>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>conda-forge now supports Python 3.13 on conda.
You can create a new environment with Python 3.13 by running the
command:</p>
<div class="language-text codeBlockContainer_Ckt0 theme-code-block" style="--prism-color:#393A34;--prism-background-color:#f6f8fa"><div class="codeBlockContent_QJqH"><pre tabindex="0" class="prism-code language-text codeBlock_bY9V thin-scrollbar" style="color:#393A34;background-color:#f6f8fa"><code class="codeBlockLines_e6Vv"><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain">conda create -n py313 python=3.13 -c conda-forge</span><br></span></code></pre></div></div>
<p>This will create a new environment with Python 3.13 with the global
interpreter lock (GIL) enabled. A migration is underway that builds
Python extensions like those included in <code>numpy</code> and <code>scipy</code> as conda packages. The migration
is <a class="" href="https://conda-forge.org/status/migration/?name=python313">55% complete</a> at the time of writing.</p>
<p>New in this Python release is the <code>python-freethreading</code> build which
removes the GIL and enables free threading. To install a <code>freethreading</code>
build, you can do:</p>
<div class="language-text codeBlockContainer_Ckt0 theme-code-block" style="--prism-color:#393A34;--prism-background-color:#f6f8fa"><div class="codeBlockContent_QJqH"><pre tabindex="0" class="prism-code language-text codeBlock_bY9V thin-scrollbar" style="color:#393A34;background-color:#f6f8fa"><code class="codeBlockLines_e6Vv"><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain">conda create -n py313 python=3.13 python-freethreading -c conda-forge</span><br></span></code></pre></div></div>
<p>Analogous to this package we also have a metapackage to explicitly
install the GIL variant:</p>
<div class="language-text codeBlockContainer_Ckt0 theme-code-block" style="--prism-color:#393A34;--prism-background-color:#f6f8fa"><div class="codeBlockContent_QJqH"><pre tabindex="0" class="prism-code language-text codeBlock_bY9V thin-scrollbar" style="color:#393A34;background-color:#f6f8fa"><code class="codeBlockLines_e6Vv"><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain">conda create -n py313 python=3.13 python-gil -c conda-forge</span><br></span></code></pre></div></div>
<p>Note that there are no conda packages for freethreading Python extensions yet and
we hope to start a migration for freethreading extensions in the
coming weeks. Till then, you should use <code>pip</code> to install a package
unless the package and all its Python dependencies are <code>noarch</code> in which
case conda installing the package will work.</p>
<p>Another new feature of this release is the experimental just-in-time
(JIT) compiler included in the Python interpreter. This interpreter is
experimental, but can be used by setting the environment variable</p>
<div class="language-text codeBlockContainer_Ckt0 theme-code-block" style="--prism-color:#393A34;--prism-background-color:#f6f8fa"><div class="codeBlockContent_QJqH"><pre tabindex="0" class="prism-code language-text codeBlock_bY9V thin-scrollbar" style="color:#393A34;background-color:#f6f8fa"><code class="codeBlockLines_e6Vv"><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain">export PYTHON_JIT=1</span><br></span></code></pre></div></div>
<p>You can also use the convenience conda package to set this environment
variable for you:</p>
<div class="language-text codeBlockContainer_Ckt0 theme-code-block" style="--prism-color:#393A34;--prism-background-color:#f6f8fa"><div class="codeBlockContent_QJqH"><pre tabindex="0" class="prism-code language-text codeBlock_bY9V thin-scrollbar" style="color:#393A34;background-color:#f6f8fa"><code class="codeBlockLines_e6Vv"><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain">conda install python-jit</span><br></span></code></pre></div></div>
<p>Note that the JIT is available only for <code>x86_64</code> builds of python in
conda.</p>
<p>You can also use debug builds of Python on conda-forge for non-Windows
systems by using the <code>conda-forge/label/python_debug</code> label.</p>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>In June 2023, software engineers from
<a href="https://www.anaconda.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="">Anaconda</a> have reported a security issue in
the uninstallers that are included in the Windows versions of the
<a href="https://github.com/conda-forge/miniforge" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="">miniforge and mambaforge
installers</a>, one of the main
ways to bootstrap conda-forge based conda and mamba distributions.</p>
<p>The issue could, under specific conditions, unintentionally delete files
from your system during the uninstallation process. Anaconda has
published more details in the related
<a href="https://www.anaconda.com/blog/windows-installer-security-fix" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="">blogpost</a>
about the security fix for the miniconda and Anaconda Distribution
Windows installers as well.</p>
<p>conda-forge is committed to fix the miniforge and mambaforge installers
equally to reduce the possible impact on conda-forge users and has
worked with Anaconda to mitigate the issue.</p>
<ul>
<li class="">As such, we are strongly recommending all users of miniforge and
mambaforge to <strong>update immediately</strong> to the latest versions of
miniforge and mambaforge. Please download them from the <a href="https://github.com/conda-forge/miniforge" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="">miniforge
repository's main page</a>
or the <a href="https://github.com/conda-forge/miniforge/releases/tag/23.1.0-4" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="">release specific
page</a>.</li>
<li class="">For older versions, we are providing a <strong>security patch for already
installed miniforge and mambaforge installations</strong>. You can download
these from <a href="https://github.com/conda-forge/miniforge/releases/tag/23.1.0-4" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="">release specific

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>In early January 2023, CircleCI informed us that they had a large
<a href="https://circleci.com/blog/jan-4-2023-incident-report/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="">security breach</a>
where a third party had gained access to all the environment secrets
stored in the service. For <code>conda-forge</code>, these secrets are the API
token used to upload built packages to our staging area on
<code>anaconda.org</code> and the unique token we generate for each feedstock. The
feedstock tokens are used as part of our artifact staging process to
ensure that only the maintainers of a given feedstock can upload
packages built by that feedstock. Later in January, we were informed by
CircleCI that their security breach started on December 19, 2022, with
the bulk of the secrets being exfiltrated in plain text from their
servers a few days later. A malicious third-party with access to these
secrets could potentially upload compromised versions of any package on
<code>conda-forge</code> in a so-called "supply chain" attack.</p>
<p><strong>We have produced a</strong> <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/conda-forge/conda-forge.github.io/main/misc/circle_ci_pkgs_dec2022_breach.json" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="">list of all possibly compromised
artifacts</a>.</p>
<p><strong>If you use</strong> <code>conda-forge</code> <strong>in very sensitive environments (which we
do not recommend!), please remove these artifacts from your system.</strong></p>
<p><strong>To date, we know of no compromised artifacts in</strong> <code>conda-forge</code>.</p>
<p><strong>API tokens for the main</strong> <code>conda-forge</code> <strong>channel were never exposed
and remain secure to our knowledge.</strong></p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorTargetStickyNavbar_Vzrq" id="our-response">Our Response<a href="https://conda-forge.org/blog/2023/03/12/circle-ci-security-breach/#our-response" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Our Response" title="Direct link to Our Response" translate="no">​</a></h2>
<p>We took the following steps to respond to this incident.</p>
<ul>
<li class="">We immediately started a token rotation of all of our feedstock
tokens and our staging area upload tokens as precautionary measures.
This token rotation hit a few bugs, but was completed as of January
13, 2023.</li>
<li class="">We produced a census of all packages uploaded between December 19,
2022 and January 13, 2023. This data is available for download as a
<a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/conda-forge/conda-forge.github.io/main/misc/circle_ci_pkgs_dec2022_breach.json" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="">JSON
file</a>.</li>
<li class="">We examined all the artifacts built during this time period for the
<a href="https://circleci.com/blog/jan-4-2023-incident-report/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="">malicious
files</a> listed
by CicleCI. We did not find any of those files in our artifacts.</li>
<li class="">As detailed below, we have begun retooling our system for feedstock
tokens to be more robust and enable greater flexibility in our
response to incidents like this.</li>
<li class="">We have begun systematically invalidating old tokens,
decommissioning old bots, and minimizing permissions of our current
tokens in order to further enhance <code>conda-forge</code>'s security.</li>
</ul>
<p>Rotating all of our tokens was taken as a precautionary measure.
Unfortunately, during this token rotation, one of our bots encountered a
bug which resulted in us losing the tokens for a very large fraction of
feedstocks. This situation resulted in an extended outage that lasted
about five days and was resolved on January 13, 2023, when the full
token rotation was completed.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorTargetStickyNavbar_Vzrq" id="what-did-we-learn">What did we learn?<a href="https://conda-forge.org/blog/2023/03/12/circle-ci-security-breach/#what-did-we-learn" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to What did we learn?" title="Direct link to What did we learn?" translate="no">​</a></h2>
<p>We learned a few things about our system for feedstock tokens and
general maintenance of our CI service integrations. We probably should
have known them already, but here we are.</p>
<ul>
<li class="">We used the same feedstock token across multiple CI services. This
limited our ability to immediately invalidate tokens associated with
a single CI service and exposed all services if any single service
had an incident.</li>
<li class="">Our token system only allowed one valid token per feedstock. This
limitation means that we cannot recover from partially failed token
resets/rotations and are subject to race conditions during the
reset/rotation process that can cause failed package uploads.</li>
<li class="">We need to be more proactive about cleaning up deprecated/removed CI
services. The use of CircleCI in <code>conda-forge</code> has been deprecated
for quite a while. Had we taken the time, and had the foresight, to
remove all of our secrets from CircleCI when it was deprecated, we
could have avoided the security incident all together.</li>
</ul>
<p>We have begun retooling our system for feedstock tokens in order to fix
the issues identified above and allow us to have more flexibility in
responding to security incidents. We have also started the process of
decommissioning several of our old CI services. These changes will take
time to implement. You can follow the progress on our various public
issue trackers.</p>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This blog is about my work during my Outreachy internship with]]></summary>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>This blog is about my work during my Outreachy internship with
<a href="https://conda-forge.github.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="">conda-forge</a>. Before that a little about
me - I am <a href="https://github.com/ssurbhi560" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="">Surbhi</a>, an Outreachy intern
with conda-forge for the May-August 2022 cohort and I worked on
documenting the conda-forge ecosystem.</p>
<p>The first issue I started working on when the internship began was
<a href="https://github.com/conda-forge/conda-forge.github.io/issues/1611" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="">Better anchoring of
announcements(#1611)</a>.
The goal of this issue was to fix the anchor for each year and also
specific announcements in the Announcements section so as to provide
better navigation of the <a href="https://conda-forge.org/docs/user/announcements.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="">Announcements
page</a>. This was
also the time when I was feeling quite overwhelmed and anxious since I
was just starting and was unsure if I would be able to give my best. But
thanks to my awesome mentors
<a href="https://github.com/kathatherine" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="">@Katherine</a> and
<a href="https://github.com/beckermr" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="">@Matt</a>, who have always been so helpful,
I was able to have a good start. We solved this issue in two parts. The
first part was to add anchors to each year which is solved with <a href="https://github.com/conda-forge/conda-forge.github.io/pull/1766" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="">Improve
anchors for each year in the Announcements section.
(#1766)</a>,
and the second part was adding anchors to each announcement and fixing
the RSS feed.</p>
<p>The part of the documentation I focused on after completing the first
issue was <a href="https://conda-forge.org/docs/maintainer/00_intro.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="">Maintainers'
Documentation</a>.
Many open issues needed to be taken care of to make the Maintainers'
documentation more useful and accessible for new maintainers. The open
tickets that we have worked on are:</p>
<ol>
<li class="">
<p><a href="https://github.com/conda-forge/conda-forge.github.io/issues/1769" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="">Document extras feedstock-name

(#1772)</a>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>As we started with improving the Maintainer documentation, these
were the issues we picked first to work on. The first issue was
documenting how maintainers can use the "feedstock-name" directive
for naming feedstocks differently than their package names in
staged recipes. The second issue was documenting how one should
become a package maintainer.</p>

<p>I met some wonderful people during the internship who helped me with all
my questions and doubts that I had. The experience during the internship
also helped me get better opportunities after completing the Outreachy
internship. I have learned so many things during the internship that it
would make a long list if I were to write all of those. But the most
important things I learned are:</p>
<ul>
<li class="">The importance of documentation and how to write good documentation.</li>
<li class="">The best practices to follow while writing documentation.</li>
<li class="">More about conda-forge and packaging tools.</li>
</ul>
<p>And above all, Outreachy helped me feel more confident about my skills
and overcome the imposter syndrome I had before. Thanks again to my
awesome mentors and the kind people of the conda-forge community! :)</p>]]></content>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Tensorflow on Anvil]]></summary>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://i.imgur.com/pRdJaYw.png" alt="Tensorflow on Anvil" class="img_ev3q"></p>
<p>Recently we've been able to add GPU-enabled TensorFlow builds to
conda-forge! This was quite a journey, with multiple contributors trying
different ways to convince the Bazel-based build system of TensorFlow to
build CUDA-enabled packages. But we managed, <a href="https://github.com/conda-forge/tensorflow-feedstock/pull/157" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="">and the pull request got
merged</a>.</p>
<p>We now have a configuration in place that creates CUDA-enabled
TensorFlow builds for all conda-forge supported configurations (CUDA
10.2, 11.0, 11.1, and 11.2+). Building out the CUDA packages requires
beefy machines -- on a 32 core machine it still takes around 3 hours to
build a single package. Our build matrix now includes 12 CUDA-enabled
packages &amp; 3 CPU packages (because we need separate packages per Python
version). As one can imagine, this isn't easily possible on an average
"home computer".</p>
<p>For this purpose, we have written an Ansible playbook that lets us boot
up cloud machines which then build the feedstock (using the
<code>build-locally.py</code> script). Thanks to the generous support
of OVH we were able to boot multiple 32-core virtual machines
simultaneously to build the different TensorFlow variants.</p>
<p>We have open-sourced the <a href="https://github.com/mamba-org/build-locally-ansible" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="">Ansible playbook in
GitHub</a> and we're
working towards making it (more) generally useful for other long-running
builds!</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://i.imgur.com/nvV6izV.jpg" alt="Running 3 builds in parallel on 32 cores ... still takes around 3 hours to finish" class="img_ev3q"></p>
<p>With the TensorFlow builds in place, conda-forge now has CUDA-enabled
builds for PyTorch and Tensorflow, the two most popular deep learning
libraries.</p>
<p>We are still missing Windows builds for TensorFlow (CPU &amp; CUDA,
unfortunately) and would love the community to help us out with that.
There is an open PR, but it probably needs some poking in Bazel to get
it to pass: <a href="https://github.com/conda-forge/tensorflow-feedstock/pull/111" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="">conda-forge/tensorflow-feedstock#111</a>.</p>
<p>We hope that these new GPU builds will enable many more packages to be
added to the conda-forge channel! We are already looking forward to the
2.6.2 and 2.7 releases of TensorFlow and to adding Windows support in
the future. We hope you enjoy this work.</p>

<p>You can now select between GPU enabled (default) and CPU packages using
the <code>tensorflow-gpu</code> and <code>tensorflow-cpu</code> packages. Just run</p>
<div class="language-bash codeBlockContainer_Ckt0 theme-code-block" style="--prism-color:#393A34;--prism-background-color:#f6f8fa"><div class="codeBlockContent_QJqH"><pre tabindex="0" class="prism-code language-bash codeBlock_bY9V thin-scrollbar" style="color:#393A34;background-color:#f6f8fa"><code class="codeBlockLines_e6Vv"><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain">mamba </span><span class="token function" style="color:#d73a49">install</span><span class="token plain"> tensorflow-gpu </span><span class="token parameter variable" style="color:#36acaa">-c</span><span class="token plain"> conda-forge</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain"></span><span class="token comment" style="color:#999988;font-style:italic"># OR</span><span class="token plain"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain">conda </span><span class="token function" style="color:#d73a49">install</span><span class="token plain"> tensorflow-gpu </span><span class="token parameter variable" style="color:#36acaa">-c</span><span class="token plain"> conda-forge</span><br></span></code></pre></div></div>
<p>When installing the <code>tensorflow</code> package, the package resolution will
now default to the GPU-enabled builds of tensorflow if the local machine
has a GPU (these builds can be identified by "cuda" at the beginning
of the version number). Note that GPU-enabled packages can also work on
CPU-only machines, but one would need to override the enviornment
variable <code>CONDA_OVERRIDE_CUDA</code> like below. This could be handy if you
are in a situation where your current node (e.g. login node) on an HPC
does not have GPUs, but the compute nodes with GPUs do not have internet
access.</p>

<p>Note that you should select the cudatoolkit version most appropraite for
your GPU; currently, we have "10.2", "11.0", "11.1", and "11.2"
builds available where the the "11.2" builds are compatible with all
cudatoolkits&gt;=11.2. You could also force a specific version of
<code>cudatoolkit</code> by specifying it like above. Moreover, you could ensure
you get a sepcific build of tensorflow by appending the package name
like <code>tensorflow==2.7.0=cuda*</code> or <code>tensorflow==2.7.0=cuda112*</code>. If you
want the slimmer "cpu-only" package, then you can install
<code>tensorflow-cpu</code> directly or equivalently <code>tensorflow==2.7.0=cpu*</code>. At
the time of writing (February 2022), on a machine without a GPU, one
would always get the <code>-cpu</code> variant unless overriden like
above. This decision has been made to allow greater accessibility for
users with limited bandwidth and resources.</p>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>On September 9, 2021 one of our core devs discovered that artifacts
building on Travis CI were being uploaded to our conda channel from PRs
running on forked repositories. A quick investigation revealed that
Travis CI was passing encrypted secrets to PR builds on forks. Further
examination of our logs and artifacts indicated that this had been
happening since about September 3, 2021. This security bug was
subsequently confirmed by Travis CI. See this
<a href="https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-41077" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="">CVE</a> for more details
on this incident. <strong>As far as we know, there were no actual exploits
against conda-forge which used this vulnerability.</strong></p>

<p>We took the following steps to respond to this incident.</p>
<ol>
<li class="">We immediately turned off all builds on Travis CI by suspending the
Travis CI GitHub App.</li>
<li class="">We immediately disclosed the bug to Travis CI through our contacts
there.</li>
<li class="">Once Travis CI indicated to us that they were ready, we rotated all
feedstock tokens and later our anaconda.org token for our staging
channel. The anaconda.org token for the main <code>conda-forge</code> channel
was never disclosed in this incident. Further, only ~70 feedstocks
had their tokens exposed in this incident.</li>
<li class="">We examined our artifacts and marked as broken any artifacts that
were uploaded from PRs. We think we found everything, but we are not
completely sure. Our criterion for marking things broken was more
generous than it needed to be.</li>
<li class="">We issued PRs to rebuild any broken artifacts via our bots.</li>
<li class="">We put in changes to <code>conda-smithy</code> to help prevent inadvertent
uploads of artifacts from PRs in the future.</li>

<p>I (MRB) want to recognize the quick work of our core dev team in
handling this incident. It goes without saying that the public nature of
<code>conda-forge</code>'s infrastructure carries risks. On the other hand, by
being public, anyone can look and verify our artifact builds. Security
for <code>conda-forge</code> is about reducing risk and we will continue to do our
best.</p>
<p>Our best defense against security incidents in <code>conda-forge</code> is <em>you</em>!
Our feedstock maintainers are in the best position to notice incidents
and issues. Please responsibly report anything you find to us at

</li>
<li class="">
<p>Fork and clone the conda-forge <a href="https://github.com/conda-forge/staged-recipes" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="">staged-recipes
repository</a> from
GitHub.</p>
</li>
<li class="">
<p>Checkout a new branch from the <code>master branch</code>.</p>
</li>
<li class="">
<p>Through CLI, cd inside the 'staged-recipes/recipes' directory.</p>
</li>
<li class="">
<p>Call <code>grayskull</code> and pass the <code>pypi</code> repository, followed by the
name of the package you want to contribute to conda-forge. For
example: <code>grayskull pypi abc</code></p>
<p>Or you could use <code>grayskull pypi abc --strict-conda-forge</code> to remove
some selectors which are not necessary for conda-forge and adapt
recipes to fit better in the conda-forge ecosystem.</p>
<p>Grayskull will create a folder with the same name as the package (in
this case: 'abc') in the 'recipes' folder of the 'staged-recipes'
directory. This folder will contain the <code>meta.yaml</code> file and also
the license file if the package includes a license in the PyPI
distribution.</p>
</li>
<li class="">
<p>Go through the generated <code>meta.yaml</code> file. For simpler packages, the
generated recipes are nearly perfect, but for some packages you
might need to make certain tweaks.</p>
</li>
<li class="">
<p>Commit and push the changes. <code>git add recipe/abc/meta.yaml</code>
<code>git commit -m "add a commit message"</code> <code>git push</code></p>
</li>
<li class="">
<p>Create a PR.</p>
</li>
<li class="">
<p>Once the CI is passing, post a comment saying:
<code>This is ready for review</code> <code>@conda-forge-admin, please ping team</code></p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Once the PR gets merged, your package will be available on the
conda-forge channel. Tada! It's that easy.</p>]]></content>

<p>As with most organizations, there are lots of small issues that need
addressing usually related to problems such as bad recipes, old
documentation and others. These will make good first issues to resolve
or "update". This will also be an opportunity to familiarise yourself
with the conda-forge environment.</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorTargetStickyNavbar_Vzrq" id="larger-tasks">Larger tasks<a href="https://conda-forge.org/blog/2021/02/02/outreachy/#larger-tasks" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Larger tasks" title="Direct link to Larger tasks" translate="no">​</a></h3>
<p>There are a few potential larger tasks that can come after a few smaller
task contributions. These are included into our three main bases:</p>
<ul>
<li class=""><a href="https://conda-forge.org/docs/user/00_intro.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="">Users</a>: In this
case, some good starter tasks are mainly checking the actual
contents of conda-forge users documentations, and ideas to better
express its contents.</li>
<li class=""><a href="https://conda-forge.org/docs/maintainer/00_intro.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="">Maintainers</a>:
There are a bunch of missed topics in this area, some information
have to be updated or rewritten for better understanding. Writing a
complete guide containing the actual steps and standard model for a
package recipe, building process (just a simple discussion) and how
conda-forge bot recognize defective licenses, recipes and packages
in general is highly welcomed. For further understanding of the
general system check <a href="https://conda-forge.org/docs/maintainer/infrastructure.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="">this
link</a>.
<ul>
<li class="">It can be funny to say, but lots of helpful ideas and bug
solutions appear on our gitter channel, so if you have time to
write guides about them... it's also an incredible task.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li class=""><a href="https://conda-forge.org/docs/orga/00_intro.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="">And organization</a>
Our environment is changing everyday, because of that a lot of
information is lost in this process or even worse, not documented at
all! which leads to some difficulties inserting new members to
develop and further enhance the current process.
<ul>
<li class="">The related work on this matter is highly welcomed and for a
better grasp of the situation you can start with this
<a href="https://conda-forge.org/docs/orga/guidelines.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="">guideline</a>
and read some of our posts in our
<a href="https://conda-forge.org/blog/blog/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="">blog</a></li>
<li class="">Revitalizing ideas/projects for the conda-forge blog are
definitely welcomed;</li>
<li class="">Currently we have some interesting projects going on inside our
ecosystem, which in return will need good documentation... Some
of the projects conda-forge is affiliated include the <a href="https://github.com/regro/cf-scripts" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="">auto-tick
bot</a>,
<a href="https://github.com/symbol-management/symbol-exporter" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="">symbol-exporter</a>
and a new service we are eager to start developing is the
<a href="https://github.com/regro/cf-scripts/issues/1367" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="">distributed-bot</a>.
All of them have a great coverage of subjects and lots of people
to help and give advice about the service structure and
functionalities.</li>

<p>You can help improve the documentation as it is version-controlled in
the conda-forge.github.io repository on GitHub. The source text is
stored there in the <code>src/subdirectory</code> and is formatted using <a href="https://wiki.python.org/moin/reStructuredText" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="">Python's
reStructuredText system</a>.</p>
<p>You can propose quick edits directly through the GitHub website, if you
have an account there --- for instance, this
<a href="https://github.com/conda-forge/conda-forge.github.io/edit/master/src/user/contributing.rst" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="">link</a>
will take you directly to a web-based editor for this section page in
our
<a href="https://conda-forge.org/docs/user/contributing.html#improve-docs" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="">docs</a>.
In general, the file corresponding to each page in the GitHub browser
has a little pencil icon in its top-right that lets you open it up for
editing.</p>
<p>The more manual process is as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li class="">Fork the conda-forge.github.io repository to your own GitHub user
account.</li>
<li class="">Clone that fork onto your computer.</li>
<li class="">Check out a new branch deriving from master to do your work.</li>
<li class="">Make and commit your changes.</li>
<li class="">Submit a pull request to the main repository proposing your changes.</li>
</ul>
<p>Happy editing!</p>]]></content>

<p>The <code>conda-forge</code> community has grown immensely this year. Here are some
numbers to help give you an idea of the scale of our growth.</p>
<ul>
<li class="">The community has added 3,751 new, unique <code>conda</code> packages this
year, along with a corresponding number of new feedstocks.</li>
<li class="">For the majority of 2020, the <code>conda-forge</code> channel on
<code>anaconda.org</code> exceeded 100 million downloads per month.</li>
<li class="">In July of 2020, the <code>conda-forge</code> channel passed 2 billion total,
all-time downloads.</li>
<li class="">We've grown our core developer community, adding seven new members
to the <code>conda-forge</code> Core team and at least two members to the
<code>staged-recipes</code> team.</li>
<li class="">We now have over 2,500 recipe maintainers in the <code>conda-forge</code>
GitHub organization.</li>
</ul>

<p>We've also shipped a ton of big updates to our core infrastructure this
year. These updates include</p>
<ul>
<li class=""><code>PyPy</code> <strong>support</strong>: We added support for <code>PyPy</code> 3.6 and now supply
one of the biggest stacks of <code>PyPy</code>-enabled packages in the <code>PyPy</code>
ecosystem.</li>
<li class=""><strong>automerge</strong>: We now support the automatic merging of PRs on
feedstocks using the <code>automerge</code> label or through an opt-in setting
in the <code>conda-forge.yml</code>.</li>
<li class=""><code>R</code> <strong>4.0 migration</strong>: This migration was the first one to use our
<code>automerge</code> infrastructure at scale. With it, we completed a
complete rebuild/upgrade of the <code>R</code> ecosystem in about a week.</li>
<li class=""><code>Python</code> <strong>updates</strong>: We deprecated <code>Python</code> 2.7, completed the
<code>Python</code> 3.8 migration, and got about 75% of the way through the
<code>Python</code> 3.9 migration.</li>
<li class=""><strong>compiler upgrades</strong>: We upgraded our compiler infrastructure to
<code>GCC</code> 9 and <code>clang</code> 11.</li>
<li class=""><strong>CentOS 7 and CentOS 6 EOL</strong>: We shipped an option to enable our
compilers to use the CentOS 7 <code>sysroot</code> in preparation for the
CentOS 6 EOL. We hope to complete the move to CentOS 7 early next
year.</li>
<li class=""><strong>miniforge</strong>: We built our own standalone, <code>miniconda</code>-like
installers. These support a broad range of platforms, including
<code>osx-arm64</code> and <code>linux-aarch64</code>.</li>
<li class=""><strong>standalone Windows stack</strong>: We fully decoupled our Windows recipes
from the <code>defaults</code> channel by rebuilding the <code>msys2</code> recipes.</li>
<li class=""><strong>Apple silicon support</strong>: We added support for Apple silicon with
our <code>osx-arm64</code> platform. This platform is our first one to use a
fully cross-compiled infrastructure.</li>
<li class=""><strong>CUDA support</strong>: We added support for building CUDA packages on
windows and added CUDA 11.0 support.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<p>We know that this year has been extremely difficult for so many of our
community members and that the fantastic success of <code>conda-forge</code> would
not have been possible without the active participation and support of
our community. <strong>Thank you everyone so much for the work you put into</strong>
<code>conda-forge</code> <strong>this year, making it the wonderful, community-led
resource that it is.</strong></p>
<p>We wish everyone a happy, healthy, and peaceful new year!</p>]]></content>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Various members of the community have raised questions publicly and]]></summary>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Various members of the community have raised questions publicly and
privately about the implications of Anaconda's new Terms of Service
(TOS) on <code>anaconda.com</code>. First of all, we understand your concerns. We
would like to explain a bit how <code>conda-forge</code> works, how the TOS change
affects us and <code>conda-forge</code> users, and what our plans as a community
are for the future.</p>
<p>What makes it non-surprising [that no other free conda package
distribution services have appeared] is that, at the moment, any third
party channel like <code>conda-forge</code> is free. The TOS change does not apply
to <code>conda-forge</code>, nor to other channels hosted on anaconda.org; the TOS
change in question applies only to the "defaults" channel and other
software hosted on repo.anaconda.com.</p>
<p>While having alternative hosting is in our plans, we cannot afford the
costs. We are just a community of volunteers. We have experimented with
uploading the <code>conda-forge</code> artifacts to GitHub and continue to do so
(see <code>regro/releases</code>). We also have put those artifacts behind an
experimental repodata server. One of our core devs (@wolfv) is working
to setup <code>quetz</code> with <code>conda-forge</code> artifacts as well.</p>
<p>It is very important to recognize that Anaconda Inc kindly donates use
of their hosting and employee time to us, absorbing all of these costs.
They host about 1.8 TB of our data and serve over 100 million downloads
of artifacts from that data each month. This is a highly significant
donation and <code>conda-forge</code> would not exist without it. Anaconda Inc
employees also provide help with maintaining some of the most complex
package recipes in conda-forge.</p>
<p>Note that Anaconda Inc has also said that part of the revenue from the
TOS change will be donated to OSS projects. (see this <a href="https://www.anaconda.com/blog/sustaining-our-stewardship-of-the-open-source-data-science-community" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="">blog
post</a>).
You should be aware that <code>conda-forge</code> is a part of NumFOCUS, and so it
stands to benefit from the change in TOS, as do many other OSS projects.</p>
<p>We absolutely welcome help from the community to move our efforts on
building out more hosting infrastructure for <code>conda-forge</code> forward. This
could be anything from spending time developing <code>quetz</code> to providing
hosting/mirroring for our data. Please do get in contact with us if
you'd like to help out!</p>]]></content>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>A new platform <code>osx-arm64</code> has been added to the build matrix of
conda-forge. <code>osx-arm64</code> packages are built to run on upcoming macOS
arm64 processors marketed as <code>Apple Silicon</code>. An installer for this
platform can be found
<a href="https://github.com/conda-forge/miniforge/releases/latest/download/Miniforge3-MacOSX-arm64.sh" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="">here</a>.</p>
<p>This will install a conda environment with python and conda in it.
Installed conda will be able to install packages like <code>numpy, scipy</code>.
Currently there are about 100 packages out of 10000 packages pre-built
for this platform.</p>
<p>All these packages are built on conda-forge's current macOS <code>x86_64</code>
infrastructure. In order to do so, we have made lots of changes to the
infrastructure including,
<code>conda, conda-build, conda-smithy, constructor, conda-forge-ci-setup</code> to
facilitate cross-compiling which is the process of compiling a package
that will run on a <code>host</code> platform (<code>osx-arm64</code> in our case), with the
compilation done on a <code>build</code> platform (<code>osx-64</code> or <code>linux-64</code> in our
case).</p>
<p><code>osx-arm64</code> is the first conda platform that is completely bootstrapped
using conda-build's cross-compiling facility. Previously, when adding a
new platform, conda-build was built with an existing python and pip
environment on the new platform. With cross-compiling, when the
compilers and a sysroot is set up on a different platform, an existing
conda-build installation (on <code>osx-64</code> and <code>linux-64</code> in this case) will
be able to start building packages right away.</p>

<p>In order to cross compile packages for <code>osx-arm64</code> we need compilers.
So, we first built <code>clang=11.0.0.rc1</code> which has support for targetting
<code>osx-arm64</code>. We also built <code>compiler-rt=11.0.0.rc1</code> as a universal build
support both <code>osx-64</code> and <code>osx-arm64</code>.</p>
<p>Linker, archiver, <code>otool</code>, <code>install_name_tool</code> was built using the
<a href="https://github.com/tpoechtrager/cctools-port" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="">cctools-port project</a> by
Thomas Pöchtrager.</p>
<p>One issue we ran into was that the macOS 11.0 Big Sur Beta 7 required
that all executables and shared libraries be ad-hoc signed which is
signing without a verified signature. On suggestion of <code>cctools-port</code>
developer we added support to <code>cctools-port</code> to sign these executables
using <code>ldid</code> which can be used on Linux as well as macOS to sign.</p>
<p>Using these, the first cross compiled package we built was <code>libcxx</code> to
facilitate C++ builds. For the <code>osx-arm64</code> sysroot we used the
<code>MacOSX11.0.sdk</code> already installed on Azure pipelines and Travis-CI. Due
to licensing issues, we cannot distribute this, but it can be downloaded
from the Apple developer website even on Linux.</p>
<p>With clang we have a C/C++ compiler, but lack a Fortran compiler. We
used the <a href="https://github.com/iains/gcc-darwin-arm64" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="">GCC fork for
darwin-arm64</a>. First, a cross
compiler (<code>build == host != target</code>) was built. Using that compiler, we
built a <code>cross-native</code> compiler (<code>build != host == target</code>) which gave
use the shared libraries like <code>libgfortran.dylib</code>.</p>
<p>We also added support for cross compiling rust programs to the rust
packages in conda and installing <code>rust_osx-64</code> on Linux will give you a
compiler that will build packages for <code>osx-64</code>.</p>
<p>As we haven't done cross-compilation before, many packages needed to be
updated. Most were trivial changes that we automated later on. These
included getting a newer <code>config.sub</code> to identify the new autotools
platform <code>arm64-apple-darwin20.0.0</code>, adding options to CMake with the
environment variable <code>CMAKE_ARGS</code> to correctly set up the toolchain and
recipes were update to use <code>cmake ${CMAKE_ARGS} ..</code>. Running tests when
building were also disabled by guarding commands like <code>make check</code>,
<code>make test</code>, <code>ctest</code> with the env variable
<code>CONDA_BUILD_CROSS_COMPILATION</code>.</p>
<p>Cross-compiling python extensions is quite tricky as <code>distutils</code> is not
really setup to do this. Thanks to the project
<a href="https://github.com/benfogle/crossenv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="">crossenv</a> this is unofficially
supported with a few quirks. With <code>crossenv</code>, we can run a python on the
build machine (<code>osx-64</code> or <code>linux-64</code> in this case) that acts like it is
on <code>osx-arm64</code>. <code>crossenv</code> monkey-patches a few functions like
<code>os.uname</code> and sets up values like <code>_PYTHON_SYSCONFIG_DATA</code> to make
python running on <code>osx-64</code> or <code>linux-64</code> behave like <code>osx-arm64</code>. One
issue is that, monkey-patching <code>sys.platform</code> doesn't work and
therefore if a python package in it's <code>setup.py</code> uses <code>sys.platform</code> to
differentiate OSes this will lead to unintended consequences if you are
cross-compiling from <code>linux-64</code>. Therefore, we have to use <code>osx-64</code> as
our <code>build</code> system when cross-compiling for <code>osx-arm64</code>. Note that
packages using <code>sysconfig.get_platform()</code> will get the correct platform.</p>
<p>For creating an installer for conda, we needed a standalone conda
executable to bootstrap the conda environment. For other platforms we
relied on <code>conda-standalone</code> which is a standalone conda executable
created using <code>pyinstaller</code>. Since <code>pyinstaller</code> does not support
cross-compile, we decided to use <code>micromamba</code> as the bootstrapper and
added features to <code>micromamba</code> so that it can function as the
bootstrapper.</p>

<p>In order to test packages intended to run on future Apple Silicon
hardware, Apple provides a machine called Developer Transition Kit
(DTK). Jonathan Helmus and Eli Rykoff has helped with testing these
packages on DTKs. Thanks to Eli Rykoff, we are now running tests for
these packages as a daily cron job which has led to finding several bugs
in our cross compiling infrastructure and also bugs in our recipes.</p>
<p>To test cross compiled recipes, transfer the built conda package to the
<code>host</code> and run,</p>

including the upstream maintainers of compiler infrastructure (which
includes conda, conda-build, cctools, tapi, cctools-port, ldid, llvm,
clang, compiler-rt, openmp, libcxx, crossenv, rust, gcc-darwin-arm64),
<code>conda-forge/help-osx-arm64</code> team including Matt Becker, Eli Rykoff and
Uwe Korn who sent PRs to fix recipes, <code>conda-forge/bot</code> team and also
all the conda-forge maintainers of the 100 feedstocks who reviewed and
fixed PRs.</p>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>tl;dr Depending on specific version numbers of underlying libraries may
be too inaccurate and cause headaches as upstream libraries evolve and
change. A more detailed approach is needed. In this post I outline
current and potential work on a path towards a more complete inspection
of requirements based on APIs and dynamic pinning of libraries.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorTargetStickyNavbar_Vzrq" id="what-constitutes-a-good-version-number">What Constitutes a Good Version Number<a href="https://conda-forge.org/blog/2020/10/02/versions/#what-constitutes-a-good-version-number" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to What Constitutes a Good Version Number" title="Direct link to What Constitutes a Good Version Number" translate="no">​</a></h2>
<p>Version numbers should constitute a set that has the following
properties</p>
<ol>
<li class="">The set must be unbounded</li>
<li class="">The set must be orderable (maybe)</li>
</ol>
<p>Of course sets that meet these requirements might not convey a lot of
information about the software they represent other than if two things
are equivalent and their comparative ages. Note that the requirement to
be orderable may not be needed, but is generally useful when considering
the idea of an "upgrade" since it provides a clear delineation between
older and newer packages. In many cases, the structure of the version
number provides additional information. For some projects the version
number includes the date of the release, often using <a href="https://calver.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="">cal
ver</a>. Many projects use <a href="https://semver.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="">semantic
versioning</a>, which attempts to encode information
about the underlying source code's API in the version number.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorTargetStickyNavbar_Vzrq" id="version-numbers-and-api-pinning">Version Numbers and API Pinning<a href="https://conda-forge.org/blog/2020/10/02/versions/#version-numbers-and-api-pinning" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Version Numbers and API Pinning" title="Direct link to Version Numbers and API Pinning" translate="no">​</a></h2>
<p>One of the most important places where version numbers are specified is
during the pinning of APIs. Source code often requires specific APIs
from the libraries it uses. This requires a pin specifying which
versions of the underlying libraries can be used. The package manager
then uses these pins to make certain a compatible environment is
created.</p>
<p>However, these pins (or even the lack of pins) produce problems.
Firstly, the pins are a one-time, local statement about the current and
future, global ecosystem of packages. For instance a pin of <code>scipy</code> to
the current major version number may not hold up over time, newer
versions of <code>scipy</code> may break the API while not changing the major
version number. Similarly the lack of pin for <code>scipy</code> could be false as
the API breaks. Even pins that establish firm upper and lower bounds may
be false as new versions of the pinned library restore the missing API.
These issues are particularly problematic for dependency systems that
tie the pins to a particular version of the source code, requiring a new
version to be created to update the pins. Conda-Forge is able to avoid
some of these issues via <a href="https://github.com/conda-forge/conda-forge-repodata-patches-feedstock" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="">repodata
patching</a>,
dynamically updating a package's stated requirements. Overall this
process is fraught, as each package depends on different portions of a
library's API, a version bump that breaks one package may leave others
unscathed.</p>

<p>All of the above issues are caused by the confusion of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Map%E2%80%93territory_relation" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="">the map for the
territory</a>.
The map, in this case the version number of a library, can not
accurately represent the territory, the API itself. To fix this issue we
need a more accurate description of the territory. Achieving this will
not be easy, but I think there is an approach that gets close enough to
limit the number of errors.</p>
<p>We need a programmatic way to check if a particular library, for a
particular version, provides the required API. I think this can be
achieved iteratively, with each step providing additional clarity and
difficulty of implementation. Note that in the steps below, I'm using
python packaging as an example, but I imagine that these steps are
general enough to apply to other languages and ecosystems.</p>
<ol>
<li class="">Determine which libraries are requirements of the code, this is
provided by tools like
<a href="https://github.com/ericdill/depfinder" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="">depfinder</a> and are starting
to be integrated into the Conda-Forge bot systems (although they are
still highly experimental and being worked on).</li>
<li class="">Determine if the a version of the library provides the needed
modules. This could be accomplished by using depfinder to find the
imports and use the mapping provided by
<a href="https://github.com/regro/libcfgraph/tree/master/import_maps" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="">libcfgraph</a>
between the import names and the versions of packages that ship
those imports.</li>
<li class="">Determine if an imported module provides the symbols being imported.
This would require a listing of all the symbols in a given python
module, including top level scoped variables, function names, class
names, methods, etc.</li>
<li class="">For callables determine if the used call signature matches the
method or function definition.</li>
</ol>
<p>The <a href="https://github.com/ericdill/depfinder" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="">depfinder</a> project has made
significant advances along this path, providing an easy to use tool to
extract accurate import and package requirement data from source code.
Depfinder even has cases to handle imports that are within code blocks
that might make the requirement optional or use the python standard
library. Future work on depfinder, including using more accurate maps
between imports and package names and providing metadata on package
requirements that are collectively exhaustive (for instance imports of
<code>pyqt4</code> vs. <code>pyqt5</code> in a <code>try: except:</code> block), will provide even more
accurate information on requirements.</p>
<p>At each one of the above stages we can provide significant value to
users, maintainers and source code authors by helping them to keep their
requirements consistent and warning when there are conflicts.
Conda-Forge can update its repodata as new versions of imported
libraries are created, to properly represent if that version is API
compatible with it's downstream consumers. Additionally the tables that
list all the symbols and call signatures can be provided to 3rd party
consumers that may want to patch their own metadata or check if a piece
of source code is self consistent in its requirements. This will also
help with the loosening of pins, creating more solvable environments for
Conda-Forge and other packaging ecosystems. Furthermore, as this tooling
matures and becomes more accurate it can be incorporated into the
Conda-Forge bot systems to automatically update dependencies during
version bumps and repodata patches, helping reduce maintenance burden.</p>
<p>Tools built from the symbol table can also have impacts far beyond
Conda-Forge. For instance, the symbol tables could allow source code
authors to have a line by line inspection of their code, revealing which
lines force the use of older or newer versions of dependencies. This
could enable large scale migrations of source code with surgical
precision, enabling developers to extract and re-write the few lines of
code preventing the use of a new version of a library.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorTargetStickyNavbar_Vzrq" id="caveats">Caveats<a href="https://conda-forge.org/blog/2020/10/02/versions/#caveats" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Caveats" title="Direct link to Caveats" translate="no">​</a></h2>
<p>There are some important caveats to this approach that need to be kept
in mind.</p>
<ol>
<li class="">All of this work is aimed at understanding the API of a given
library, this approach can not provide insight into the code inside
of the API, or if changes there impact downstream consumers. For
instance, version updates that fix bugs and security flaws in
library code may not change the API at all. From this tooling's
perspective there is no reason to upgrade since the API is not
different. Of course there is a strong reason to upgrade in this
case, since buggy or vulnerable libraries could be a huge headache
and liability for downstream code and should be removed as quickly
as possible.</li>
<li class="">Some features may depend on broader adoption by the community. For
instance, this approach would benefit greatly from python type
hints, since the API could be constrained down to the expected
types. Such type constraints would provide much more accuracy to the
API version range as any changes could be detected. However, type
hints may not be adopted in the python community at a high enough
rate to truly be useful for this application.</li>
<li class="">Source code is fundamentally flexible. There may be knots of code
that even this approach could not cut through, especially as
multiple languages and runtime module loading come into the picture.
My personal hope would be that the code recognizes when these
situations occur, provides its best guess of what is going on, and
provides sufficient metadata to users so that they understand the
decreased accuracy of the results. Fundamentally the tooling can
only provide very educated guesses and context to users, who then
need to go figure out what is actually going on inside the code.</li>
</ol>
<h2 class="anchor anchorTargetStickyNavbar_Vzrq" id="conclusion">Conclusion<a href="https://conda-forge.org/blog/2020/10/02/versions/#conclusion" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Conclusion" title="Direct link to Conclusion" translate="no">​</a></h2>
<p>Version number based pins are imprecise representations of API
compatibility. More accurate representations based on source code
inspection would make the Conda-Forge ecosystem more robust and flexible
while reducing maintenance burden. Some of the path to achieving this is
built, and near future steps can be achieved with current tooling and
databases.</p>]]></content>
