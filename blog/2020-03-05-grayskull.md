# By the power of Grayskull... I have the Conda recipe!

_The main goal of the Skeleto_~~n~~_r is to conquer Grayskull._

## Introduction

All jokes aside, the new project
[grayskull](https://github.com/marcelotrevisani/grayskull) was created
with the **intention** of generating better Conda recipes that would
allow to package properly projects available in different channels such
as PyPI, CRAN, Conan, GitHub register, GitHub repositories and so on. On
top of that, Grayskull is also being developed to help
[conda-forge](https://conda-forge.org/) to update recipes.

<!--truncate-->

## Current status

Currently, Grayskull (version `0.2.1`) is able to generate recipes just
looking for packages on [PyPI](https://pypi.org/), and it is available
on [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/grayskull/) and
[conda-forge](https://github.com/conda-forge/grayskull-feedstock). The
GitHub repository for this package is:
[marcelotrevisani/grayskull](https://github.com/marcelotrevisani/grayskull).

Before Grayskull, we just had `conda-build skeleton` to generate recipes
for Python packages on PyPI. In all other aspects, the difference of
quality of the generated recipes, and also the time spent to generate
them have a big discrepancy when compared to `conda-build skeleton` and
`grayskull`. Grayskull generates recipes taking in consideration the
platform, Python version available, selectors, compilers (Fortran, C and
C++), packages constrains, license type, license file, and so forth. It
uses metadata available from multiple sources to try to create the best
recipe possible.

## Installation

You can install `grayskull` using `pip` or `conda`. `Grayskull` does not
rely on `conda` to run and can generate recipes with minimum
dependencies.

### With conda

Grayskull is available on the conda-forge channel.

```bash
conda install -c conda-forge grayskull
```

### With pip

```bash
pip install grayskull
```

## Grayskull vs conda-build skeleton

There are some differences of recipes generated by `grayskull` and
`conda skeleton`. Taking as example the `pytest` recipe, which has
selectors for platforms, Python version constrains, and has several
package constrains as well.

### Grayskull (0.2.1) - took 4 seconds to generate the recipe

In the case of `noarch: python`, Grayskull is smart enough to detect
when the recipe supports it, which is not done by Skeleton. It is
important to highlight that Skeleton does not detect compilers as well.
Nevertheless, Grayskull always try to detect it.

## Usage Grayskull (0.2.1)

Project options:

```bash
$ grayskull --help
usage: grayskull [-h] [--version] {pypi} ...

Grayskull - Conda recipe generator

positional arguments:
{pypi}         Options to generate PyPI recipes
pypi         Generate recipes based on PyPI

optional arguments:
-h, --help     show this help message and exit
--version, -v  Print Grayskull version and exit
```

```bash
$ grayskull pypi --help
usage: grayskull pypi [-h] [--maintainers MAINTAINERS [MAINTAINERS...]]
[--output OUTPUT]
pypi_packages [pypi_packages ...]

positional arguments:
pypi_packages         Specify the PyPI package name.

optional arguments:
-h, --help            show this help message and exit
--maintainers MAINTAINERS [MAINTAINERS ...], -m MAINTAINERS [MAINTAINERS...] List of maintainers which will be added to the recipe.
--output OUTPUT, -o OUTPUT Path to where the recipe will be created
```

To generate the recipe you can just call `grayskull` and pass the
channel (as for now we are just supporting PyPI, it should be pypi) and
the package name. You should also specify an output folder using the
option `--output` or `-o` and it will create the package folder, and the
recipe in there. It is important to note that the user can specify a
list of maintainers which will be added to the recipe using the option
`--maintainers`.

Example for pytest:

![Grayskull CLI](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/marcelotrevisani/grayskull/15e4a0317da4e6c2f66a381329682b7e9dc70da0/docs/images/cli_example_grayskull.gif)

If you need to specify the package version you can do it just puting the
equal sign after the package name and the version just right after that.
Example:

```bash
grayskull pypi requests=2.21.0
```

or

```bash
grayskull pypi requests==2.21.0
```

![Grayskull pinned package -requests](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/marcelotrevisani/grayskull/15e4a0317da4e6c2f66a381329682b7e9dc70da0/docs/images/cli_example_grayskull_version.gif)

If you want to generate multiple recipes just pass a list of packages,
such as:

```bash
grayskul pypi pytest requests=2.21.0 colorama
```

## Future plans

> - For the next major version (1.0.0) it is planned to add the
>   functionality to be able to load the recipe and update just parts
>   of it;
> - Generate Conda recipes using CRAN (R) channel (2.0.0);
> - Generate Conda recipes using Conan (C++) channel (3.0.0);

## Issues

Any problem, question, suggestions please feel free to open [an issue on
the repository](https://github.com/marcelotrevisani/grayskull/issues).

Contributions are very welcome! :)
