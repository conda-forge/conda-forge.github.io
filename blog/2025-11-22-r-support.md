# R support in conda-forge

Earlier this month, Anaconda [announced](https://www.anaconda.com/blog/changes-to-anacondas-r-channel-support) that they are deprecating the `r` channel bundled in the `defaults` multichannel.

This decision does _not_ impact R packages in conda-forge. The [`@conda-forge/r` team](https://github.com/conda-forge/r-feedstock/blob/7de3342693b3e1e98c2461d5385d8ebcce6b04db/recipe/meta.yaml#L30-L40) currently maintains [4.4K+ feedstocks](https://github.com/search?type=code&q=org%3Aconda-forge+%22-+conda-forge%2Fr%22+path%3Arecipe%2F) and will continue to do so.
