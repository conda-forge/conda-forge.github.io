## One billion downloads per month

While there are too many important milestones to name across those 10 years, just [a few days
ago](https://github.com/conda-forge/by-the-numbers/commit/09eefe47d4cd1c4d9bc29c2ea5f9b07cc9100433),
we passed 1,000,000,000 monthly downloads across all packages for the first time ever. ðŸ¥³ 

In total, we have served almost 27 billion downloads, and that's not even counting all those that
happen behind various institutional caching layers. This tells us that the fruits of this community
collaboration are having an enormous impact. If you'd like to share where conda-forge has saved you
hours of work, streamlined your processes, or made some ideas possible at all, please also jump in
on the zulip link above!

## Why today?

This date can be found as the creation date of the `conda-forge` Github organization:
