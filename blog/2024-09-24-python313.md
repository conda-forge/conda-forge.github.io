# Python 3.13 Release candidate builds on conda-forge

conda-forge now supports python 3.13 release candidates on conda.
You can create a new environment with python 3.13 by running the
command:

    conda create -n py313 python=3.13 -c conda-forge/label/python_rc -c conda-forge

This will create a new environment with python 3.13 with global
interpreter lock (GIL) enabled. A migration is underway that builds
python extensions like numpy and scipy conda packages. The migration
is 50% complete at the time of writing. Once the first release of
python 3.13.0 is available the `python_rc` label will not be needed
anymore.

New in this python release is the python-freethreading build which
removes the GIL and enables free threading. To install a freethreading
build, you can do:
    
    conda create -n py313 python=3.13 python-freethreading -c conda-forge/label/python_rc -c conda-forge

Analogous to this package we also have a meta-package to explicitly
install the GIL variant:

    conda create -n py313 python=3.13 cpython-gil -c conda-forge/label/python_rc -c conda-forge

Note that there are no conda packages for python extensions yet and
we hope to start a migration for freethreading extensions in the
coming weeks. Till then, you should use pip to install a package
unless the package and all its python dependencies are noarch in which
case conda installing the package will work.

Another new feature of this release is the experimental just-in-time
(JIT) compiler included in the python interpreter. This interpreter is
experimental, but can be used by setting the environment variable

    export PYTHON_GIL=1

You can also use the convenience conda package to set this environment
variable for you:

    conda install python-jit

Note that the JIT is available only for x86_64 builds of python in
conda.

You can also use debug builds of python on conda-forge for non-windows
systems by using the `conda-forge/label/python_debug` label.
