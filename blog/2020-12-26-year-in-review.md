# 2020 in Review

As 2020 winds down, the Core team thought it'd be fun to review some of
the big accomplishments our community has made this year.

<!-- truncate -->

## Strong Growth

The `conda-forge` community has grown immensely this year. Here are some
numbers to help give you an idea of the scale of our growth.

- The community has added 3,751 new, unique `conda` packages this
  year, along with a corresponding number of new feedstocks.
- For the majority of 2020, the `conda-forge` channel on
  `anaconda.org` exceeded 100 million downloads per month.
- In July of 2020, the `conda-forge` channel passed 2 billion total,
  all-time downloads.
- We've grown our core developer community, adding seven new members
  to the `conda-forge` Core team and at least two members to the
  `staged-recipes` team.
- We now have over 2,500 recipe maintainers in the `conda-forge`
  GitHub organization.

## Big New Features

We've also shipped a ton of big updates to our core infrastructure this
year. These updates include

- `PyPy` **support**: We added support for `PyPy` 3.6 and now supply
  one of the biggest stacks of `PyPy`-enabled packages in the `PyPy`
  ecosystem.
- **automerge**: We now support the automatic merging of PRs on
  feedstocks using the `automerge` label or through an opt-in setting
  in the `conda-forge.yml`.
- `R` **4.0 migration**: This migration was the first one to use our
  `automerge` infrastructure at scale. With it, we completed a
  complete rebuild/upgrade of the `R` ecosystem in about a week.
- `Python` **updates**: We deprecated `Python` 2.7, completed the
  `Python` 3.8 migration, and got about 75% of the way through the
  `Python` 3.9 migration.
- **compiler upgrades**: We upgraded our compiler infrastructure to
  `GCC` 9 and `clang` 11.
- **CentOS 7 and CentOS 6 EOL**: We shipped an option to enable our
  compilers to use the CentOS 7 `sysroot` in preparation for the
  CentOS 6 EOL. We hope to complete the move to CentOS 7 early next
  year.
- **miniforge**: We built our own standalone, `miniconda`-like
  installers. These support a broad range of platforms, including
  `osx-arm64` and `linux-aarch64`.
- **standalone Windows stack**: We fully decoupled our Windows recipes
  from the `defaults` channel by rebuilding the `msys2` recipes.
- **Apple silicon support**: We added support for Apple silicon with
  our `osx-arm64` platform. This platform is our first one to use a
  fully cross-compiled infrastructure.
- **CUDA support**: We added support for building CUDA packages on
  windows and added CUDA 11.0 support.

We know that this year has been extremely difficult for so many of our
community members and that the fantastic success of `conda-forge` would
not have been possible without the active participation and support of
our community. **Thank you everyone so much for the work you put into**
`conda-forge` **this year, making it the wonderful, community-led
resource that it is.**

We wish everyone a happy, healthy, and peaceful new year!
