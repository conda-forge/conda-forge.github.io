# CFEP-13 Secure Package Uploads
## https://github.com/conda-forge/cfep/pull/24

Currently the `anaconda.org` tokens on each feedstock allow any `conda-forge`
feedstock maintainer to upload any output to any `anaconda.org` package.
This could allow someone to push a compromised and/or malicious build
of say the `python` package. This situation is a security risk that we
should mitigate.
