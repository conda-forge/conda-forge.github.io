What is conda-forge?
--------------------

conda-forge is a community effort and a GitHub organization which contains repositories of conda recipes and thus provides conda packages for a wide range of software. 
The built distributions are uploaded to `anaconda.org/conda-forge <https://anaconda.org/conda-forge>`__ and can be installed with `conda <https://conda.pydata.org/docs/intro.html>`_. 

**Missing a package that you would love to install with conda?**

Chances are we have already packaged it for you. You can `search <https://anaconda.org/>`__ for packages online. Look out for packages provided by our ``conda-forge`` organization.

**Cannot find a package or only outdated versions of a package?** - Everybody is welcome to contribute to our package stack!
