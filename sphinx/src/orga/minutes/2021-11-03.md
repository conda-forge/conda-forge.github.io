* [x] (IF): Running our own CI and Terms of Services (TOS)
    - Drone just killed all our jobs and new ones are not queued anymore

      to NumFOCUS.
    - TOS - asked numfocus if we are liable for people doing builds on this CI
        - Julia runs one and will reach out to NumFocus if/when something bad happens
        - If / when NumFocus comes up with a TOS, we need to adopt it.
    - TODOs:

        - Set up monitoring
            - Quantstack is setting up grafana for the mirror
        - 
    - Q's: 
        - What is stored in the sqlite DB? 
        - What happens if the server crashes? 
        - Where do the logs go?
* [ ] (WV): TensorFlow-GPU ready to go, just need to decide if GPU should get prio over CPU?!
    * 
* [ ] (CHL): Any updates/improvements needed for anaconda.org? (Context: needed to plan internal development work for 21Q4, 22Q1)
    * Support for `.conda` packages
    * (IF): ability to modify the instructions -- change the "To install this package with conda run one of the following: ..." messages; e.g., squash (default) comments about broken labels.
