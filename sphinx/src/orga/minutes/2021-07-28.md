#### From previous meeting(s)

- [x] (JK): CUDA ARM packaging
    - https://github.com/conda-forge/cudatoolkit-feedstock/pull/
    - Need to handle multiple flavors of ARM (server vs application)
        - CEP for plugin architecture: https://github.com/conda/ceps/pull/1
        - Plugin mechanism for virtual packages: https://github.com/conda/conda/issues/10131
        - New label in Conda issues for plugin related topics: https://github.com/conda/conda/labels/tag-plugins

### Your __new__() agenda items

- [x] (IF) Removing gcc sanitizer runtimes from libgcc-ng
    - https://github.com/conda-forge/ctng-compilers-feedstock/issues/60
    - Should sanitizer runtimes be a separate pacakge or removed entirely?
        - settled on moving to gcc from libgcc-ng
        - defaults would (likely) make a separate package for libasan and co.
        - we can make a libasan later even after we move things, so moving it is fine for now

- [x] (IF) arm server access
    - See the email on conda-forge-core list
    - Works-on-arm says they can't sponsor anymore and suggested we use oracle's free tier
    - Needs a card to register for the free tier
    - arm server is currently used for building pypy, qt, etc.

- [x] (MRB) votes with adoodle

- [x] (MRB) intel compiler licensing
    - [ ] matt to send info back to them

- [x] (MRB) root access to GPU cluster w/ quantsight

- [ ] (JK) CUDA 11.0+ ( https://github.com/conda-forge/conda-forge-pinning-feedstock/pull/1708 )
    - [ ] matt to make smithy release
    - [ ] will need adjustments to PR but agree we can keep the file and doc examples
        - [ ] needs some work to support older compilers for old CUDA (9.x & 10.x) cases

    * INACTIVE - Merge in with some inactive-esque status?
    * Needs new champion. Thanks for your work on this pkgw! Has unaddressed comments from pkgw as from Jan 10, 2020
    Solved: Let's defer and keep the "mixed model" we have now.

* [cfep-06](https://github.com/conda-forge/conda-forge-enhancement-proposals/pull/9) Staged-recipes review lifecycle
    * INACTIVE - Merge in with some inactive-esque status?
    * Lingering comment from @saraedum. @jakirkham, can you reply? Has unadressed comment from @saraedum from Jan 8, 2020
    * (MRB) The stalebot has solved the worst of the issues here. I think we could defer this one permanently.
    Solved: defer in favor of the stale bot for now.
    
* [cfep-15](https://github.com/conda-forge/conda-forge-enhancement-proposals/pull/15) Feedstock statuses, unmaintained
    * INACTIVE - Merge in with some inactive-esque status?
    * Needs another review. Has unaddressed updates from pkgw as of Jan 11, 2020

    * Stalled since May 26, 2020

    * Stalled debate about implementation details between Isuru, CJ and Matt

      on a temporary basis (i.e., until the migration has ended).
