### Your __new__() agenda items

* [X] (DPC) Outreachy community applications are due Sep 8/9.
    * Do we have projects?
    * Dave: We have one more call before the final deadline.
    * Filipe: regenerate recipes with grayskull
    * Jaime: post-conda-build conda-verify resurrection
    * Isuru: UCRT based mingw-w64 toolchain

* [x] (KK) Last week for current Outreachy intern, Surbhi
    * No video call presentation, but a blog post will be available
    * JK: Any pending PRs?
        * KK: https://github.com/conda-forge/conda-forge.github.io/pull/1793 <-- This one just needs a check. Should be good to merge?
        * KK: https://github.com/conda-forge/conda-forge.github.io/pull/1790 <-- This one is not fully complete, as neither Surbhi, Matt, nor I know much about Perl

* [x] (IF) Close python 3.10 migration
    - https://github.com/conda-forge/conda-forge-pinning-feedstock/pull/3273
    - Status: https://conda-forge.org/status/#python310
    - Discussed dropping Python 3.7
        - IF: Make announcement to give people a heads up about the upcoming drop in October?
        - JK: Maintaining so many Python versions at the same time might be not needed if we can rely on stable APIs like HPy
        - JK (from chat): October 3rd is when Python 3.11 comes out ( https://peps.python.org/pep-0664/ )


* [x] (JRG) [Merging glob-strings in `conda` PR](https://github.com/conda/conda/pull/11612) - is it ok to merge or too disruptive?
    * Intersection of regexes, supported by these two answers:
        * https://stackoverflow.com/a/24102500/3407590
        * https://stackoverflow.com/a/24154392/3407590

* [x] (MRB) any updates on nvidia?
    * Going well, waiting for NVIDIA to communicate with NumFOCUS.
