#### From previous meeting(s)

### Your __new__() agenda items

* (MRB) welcome to our new core members!
    * please make a PR adding yourself to core.csv in the docs if you have not (https://github.com/conda-forge/conda-forge.github.io/blob/c31dfd4fe000d52beaf0e06adabc67b70820b348/src/core.csv)

* Long-term video call options?
    * (MVN) Why not Flatiron zoom any more?
    * (ED) Voltron is happy to host but google meet is annoying because you have to "allow" everyone to join. 
      Anyone else have a zoom option?
    * (CJW) NumFOCUS seems to be able to give us a zoom room (I asked them to create it under conda-forge-core@googlegroups.com in case we need it)

* (MRB) new secrets/keys locations/handling
    * we've needed to clean this up a bit for a while now
    * now all shared keys are managed in the org secrets
    * eliminated the use of static tokens nearly everywhere in favor of github app generated tokens
        * generated token permissions have a small permission scope (basically read/write on repos and github actions triggers)
        * these tokens expire after one hour
        * still have static tokens in heroku and staged recipes
    * will be going through the current tokens and deactivating the ones I can
    * can we make some of the bot accounts non-admin users?

* (FF) NumFOCUS updates

* (IF) python 3.10 updates
    * unvendoring packages on windows
        * which means most python extensions will not be usable without activating env
    * _CONDA_PYTHON_SYSCONFIGDATA_NAME is removed
    * Need conda-build PR for 3.10.0rc1
    * (CJW) Uwe's proposal to perform the python migration on 3.10rc1 https://github.com/conda-forge/conda-forge.github.io/issues/1499

* (CJW) Packaging-Con call for proposals, sponsorships
    * The CFP is open until August 30th
    * Packaging-Con is interested in corporate sponsors
        * JRG: Asking internally :) 

* (JL) PEP 668 proposed to improve interop between Python and distro package managers
    * Review: https://github.com/python/peps/pull/2056
    * Rendered: https://github.com/python/peps/blob/e605832725b3a1f34d533bbcefbce6226fcfa1cb/pep-0668.rst
    * Related to Conda's interop functionality (https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/configuration/pip-interoperability.html)
    * JRG: Will ask Filipe (FFY00) if they want to join the calls

* (JL) Python bug about adding ability to add 3rd party install schemes
    * https://bugs.python.org/issue43976
    * Might be interesting for Conda to support (referenced from Filipe at Quansight)

* NUMFOCUS Wish List
    * https://hackmd.io/@RRHnS2XUSsKNtkPddhwnEw/H1YKZ-4bY

* (JK) what happened with azure?
