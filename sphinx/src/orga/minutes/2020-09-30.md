## Agenda

### Standing items

* [x] intros for new folks on the call

* [x] (CJ) budget
    * current approvals?
    * First meeting of the month, screenshare and show the budget?
        * Link is in Keybase (numfocus_spreadsheets.txt)
        * reimbursement request for Anthony isn't showing up yet.
        * (AS) - I have resubmitted to rocket.

#### From previous meeting(s)
* [x] (JK) Completing Python 3.8 migration/
    * Are we ready to mark this as done ( https://github.com/conda-forge/conda-forge-pinning-feedstock/pull/746 )?
    * If not, what else still needs to be done?

### Your new agenda items

* [x] (FF) Python 3.9 update?
    * Done. We need to decide if we want to merge it and play with RC or wait for the stable release (Oct 5).
    * (FF) To add test for tzdata on windows, need to include tzdata in python? Should we include it? This will increase the size of the package. System tzdata will *always* be more up to date on their system, so we may be more out of date than in the python version. tzdata should look at the system path before the local conda path first.
    * https://pypi.org/project/tzdata/
    * https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0615/ in particular https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0615/#sources-for-time-zone-data
    * https://github.com/conda-forge/python-feedstock/issues/392
      > Python distributors are encouraged to ensure that time zone data is installed
      > alongside Python whenever possible (e.g. by declaring tzdata as a dependency for the python package).
    * Ship it or no?
* [x] (Eli Rykoff, IF) update on osx arm64 and code signing
    * (ER) Got ARM packages running when the machine was received. Updated to latest Big Sur and everything broke. All dylibs and so's need to be signed for the OS to run them. Can be ad-hoc signature but it needs to be signed. Latest apple tools will autosign these tools (clang will produce an autosigned binary). Making things relocatable invalidates the signature. For arm64 binaries you run a signer tool and then things are able to run on it.
    * (IF) On Linux there's a tool to run so we can cross-compile from linux. On mac there's a system tool that's usable. 
        * Q: Does the signer system tool come with the bare system or with XCode? ER will confirm where this signer comes from.
    * (JH) Conda changes the binary when it does prefix replacement. Do we need to disable prefix replacement?
        * (CL) Prefix replacement for libcrypto.dylib, libssl.dylib, openssl executable.
    * (CL) Will Apple require an official signer cert? 
        * (ER) Release notes seem to indicate that self-signed certs are ok (for now).
        * (ED) Can Anaconda ping Apple to see if they're planning on changing this by release time?
    * (WV) Can we redistribute the signing tool?
        * (IF) Conda will need to depend on this signing tool if we're going to resign at install time
    * (MB) Do x86 packages also require signed packages?
        * (MRB) Only things on apple silicon will require this signing

* [x] (WV) ruby 2.7 can track features be removed with some other mechanism?
* [x] (WV) update on boa & quetz

### Pushed to next meeting

* [ ] (MRB for CJ) libcfgraph import tables
    * example: https://github.com/regro/libcfgraph/blob/master/import_maps/ag.json
    * only looks at .py files so probably does not cover compiled extensions
    * next move is to integrate with depfinder
    * still thinking about how to turn this info into a version requirement

    * (MRB) The stalebot has solved the worst of the issues here. I think we could defer this one permanently.

* [cfep-10](https://github.com/conda-forge/conda-forge-enhancement-proposals/pull/15) Feedstock statuses, unmaintained
    * INACTIVE - Merge in with some inactive-esque status?
    * Needs another review. Has unaddressed updates from pkgw as of Jan 11, 2020

    * Stalled since May 26, 2020
    * Active debate about moving to "broken" vs deleting from conda-forge channel
    * Active vote, ends on 2020-03-11
    * What were the results of the vote?
    * Did we hear back from NumFOCUS?

* [cfep-17](https://github.com/conda-forge/cfep/pull/32) Handling pin backports and dependency rebuilds
    * Stalled debate about implementation details between Isuru, CJ and Matt
    * **UPDATE 2020-07-22**: We in principle have agreement to render the extra pinnings needed directly in the feedstock 
      on a temporary basis (i.e., until the migration has ended).
