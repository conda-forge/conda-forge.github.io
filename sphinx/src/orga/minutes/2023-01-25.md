### Active votes

### Your __new__() agenda items

- [x] (JRG) GSoC applications: my ideas
    - Application time is open.
    - For CZI grant building infrastructure 
        - Using Docusaurs web site
        - Use this momemtum to refactor conda-forge website?
        - Example: 
            - https://czi-cf-docs.netlify.app
            - https://github.com/quansight-labs/czi-cf-docs
        - No pushback at all.
- [x] (JRG) NumFOCUS SDG for opt-in CI
    - Small Development Grant
    - https://numfocus.org/programs/small-development-grants
    - Applications start ... soon (Feb 15?)
    - Build access control for CI.
    - They have cycles and out of cycle grant submission.
        - out of cycle are less likely to be approved.
        - This is not urgent.
    - Larger issue
        - **Do we need to vote on approving grant submissions?**
        - Feeling is no.  We notify this group so we don't collide and to see if there are objections, but no formal vote.
    - Aligning on Travis?
        - Travis has been a little unstable lately.
        - https://github.com/conda-forge/conda-forge.github.io/issues/1875
        - Could make travis opt in.
        - Requires access controls.
        - 
- [x] (JRG) Certificates for signed installers
    - Miniforge
    - Sign installers that miniforge produces.
    - Have a certificate from NumFOCUS for apple, but not windows
    - https://github.com/conda-forge/miniforge/issues/201
    - Talking to Steve Dower @ Microsoft ( https://github.com/zooba ) for advice
    - Could do this for the whole community (?) (see point by Jannis below)
    - Need to look up if an EV cert is required and possibly other things (e.g., timestamping)
    - Concern about security/access to tokens/passwords on CI by non-core
        - Disolve miniforge team?
        - Promote them to core?
        - Some other way to do signing that avoids this issue?
        - ???
        - JRG: Minimized in a way with [AzureSignTool](https://github.com/vcsjones/AzureSignTool), which relies on an Azure Vault instead of passing raw certificates.
        - CHL: Can get Anaconda supply chain security team to take a look, since that's work we are doing anyways.
- [x] (JL) Conda Installer Team
    - [ ] future conda community governance team to handle underlying code/proceses to build conda installers
    - [ ] interest into joining miniforge and mambaforge into the team/repo?
    - [ ] still in the aligning/team charter writing phase
- [x] (DPC) conda-forge tutorial proposal accepted at PyCon US 2023
    - Schedule is not published yet.
    - One output is updated docs for conda-forge/staged-recipes
    - (JRG) Could create an element room for tutorial q&a
    - FF: Seek help from the community.  Tweet about possible help room for participants
- [x] (JK) OpenSSL
    - TensorFlow was a blocker.  Has already been rebuilt.
    - Couple others with unknown status.
    - With Ruby you need a current version of Ruby 
    - Same with NodeJS.
    - Is this done enough? 
    - We talked about it in this call.  There was no opposition.  In fact there was outright support for closing it!
    - so: **Yes let's close.**
    - Who will do this?  JRG will do this.
