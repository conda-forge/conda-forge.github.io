    * Amit Kumar - helping setup GPU server for CF. Jaime pulled me in.
    * Kyle - director of engineering for package building teams at anaconda

* [X] open votes
    * [x] (JRG) Python 3.10.7 and friends https://github.com/conda-forge/python-feedstock/pull/579#issuecomment-1291847544
        * will circle back to this at the end of the call

    * [x] (JRG) Status on staged-recipes application(s)?
        * [ ] https://github.com/orgs/conda-forge/teams/core/discussions/12 + another member
        * Action item: FF to take over


### From previous meeting(s)

### Your __new__() agenda items

* [x] (JK) CUDA EULA Amendment
* [x] (JK) Python debug build ( https://github.com/conda-forge/python-feedstock/pull/597 )
* [x] (WV) Announcing [prefix.dev]( https://prefix.dev )
    * Issue tracker for ideas: https://github.com/prefix-dev/prefix-dev
* [x] (WV) Planning for PackagingCon 2023 is (re)-starting (right after this meeting)
* [x] (WV) Got CZI grant for improving conda-forge infra
    * [ ] https://conda-forge.org/docs/orga/funding/00_intro.html (see submitted proposal here)
* [x] (MRB) moving to .conda is ready to ship
    * See here: https://github.com/conda-forge/conda-forge.github.io/issues/1586
    * implementation is in the ci-setup package 
        - it looks for a key in the conda-forge.yml at 
          build time and if that key exists and has the right value (conda_pkg_format: 2), then it 
          adjusts the condarc file
    * note this is not a statically set thing in conda smithy since conda build doesn't appear 
      to have a command line switch controlling the package format it outputs
        * Not at this time; code is (partially?) there, but we should probably resurrect [this CEP](https://github.com/conda-incubator/ceps/pull/15) to formalize this feature.
    * I've tested the following for .conda packages
        * packages can be uploaded through the webserver, cf-staging, etc.
        * packages can be marked broken and are removed from the repodata
        * packages be marked not broken and are added back to the repodata
        * packages can be patched and the patches appear in the repodata
        * packages are properly picked up and indexed by libcfgraph
    * Note these checks went beyond simply merging the PRs associated with these items after they passed. 
      I actually went into the repodata/graphdata and/or tried to make environments live and checked they 
      did not work or had the correct (possibly modified) deps.
    * The roll out would work as follows
        * make an announcement
        * setup an admin migration to adjust the conda-forge.yaml for every feedstock slowly
        * wait till all feedstocks are adjusted and we see no major breakages
        * adjust default in ci setup package to be .conda
    * isuru:
        * could remove the tarbz2 in repodata
    * TODO
        * [ ] make sure on announcement you mention the minimum conda version (4.7)
        * [ ] check that ci services do not do duplicate uploads
        * [ ] set compression level for big packages
            * flag is [`--zstd-compression-level`](https://github.com/conda/conda-build/blob/3baa21e0af022b3f971068566831c812497545f1/conda_build/cli/main_build.py#L159-L165)
            * default is 22, set [here](https://github.com/conda/conda-build/blob/3baa21e0af022b3f971068566831c812497545f1/conda_build/config.py#L53)
* [x] (JK) Graal Python
    * https://github.com/oracle/graalpython/issues/254
    * https://github.com/conda-forge/staged-recipes/pull/20882
    * https://github.com/conda-forge/python_abi-feedstock/pull/19
* [ ] (JRG/AK) GPU Server updates
    * gpu server is hosted by metrostar. uses github actions. whenever a job is triggered, cirun triggers job on openstack. can run 3 parallel jobs with 1 gpu v100. it is ready to run. there's an example here https://github.com/aktech/cirun-openstack-example
    * JK: how do we plug this into a feedstock? do we need a test feedstock to work with?
    * JR: needs a bit of work on conda-smithy to get this template for cirun. need to figure out a policy for opting-in to the gpu service. shouldn't be that publicly available at first. need to figure out how we face the load.
    * MRB: How do we affect which repositories have access (at org level)?
    * AK: Can add public API for configuring access
    * test feedstock: https://github.com/conda-forge/cf-autotick-bot-test-package-feedstock

* [x] (FF) Staged-recipes reviewers vote results.
       We had 33 people invited to vote, 25 core, 8 emeritus.
       only 14 voted and they all seem like active core.
       - @timsnyder: passed
       - @mfansler: passed

- [ ] DJC: What is policy for publishing forks of packages?
    - [ ] Two pull requests on staged-recipes for forks of a presumably abandoned package; both want to keep the name of the upstream package
    - [ ] https://github.com/orgs/conda-forge/teams/staged-recipes/discussions/8
    - [ ] https://github.com/conda-forge/staged-recipes/pull/20669
    - [ ] https://github.com/conda-forge/staged-recipes/pull/17965
    - Marcel: complicated topic. we shuold talk more in-depth about this in an async issue
    - will the packages clobber each other if they're both installed?
    guidance:
        - must have: dont clobber existing code (run_constrained example)
        - options: 
            - rebrand your fork
            - inject your github user name (where the fork lives) into the packge / feedstock name
            - talk to upstream and take over the fork / feedstock
    - TODO: adjust PR template to address fork naming
```
requirements:
  run_constrained:
    sdsl-lite <0.a0
```

* [x] (MB) Adding a Perl package maintainers team

[2022-06-15](https://hackmd.io/tdkRcPT3QCSkGkABpuKmTg)
* [ ] (MvN) vs2022 compiler support
    * Initial stab at some pieces https://github.com/conda-forge/vc-feedstock/pull/46
    * This is a new VC version
        * Uses existing UCRT
    * Would need to use the windows-2022 github actions image
    * TODO: follow on to change the name of the runtime to vc_runtime
    * TODO: will need patches for msys epoch for UCRT
    * (CHL) For reference: [msys2 environments](https://www.msys2.org/docs/environments/) - pick your own compiler + libstdc++ + Windows runtime adventure 
    * https://www.msys2.org/docs/package-naming/
    * (RG) "we need some version of mingw-w64 for SciPy 1.9.0 too, MSVC + gfortran will no longer work. we use an Rtools toolchain in CI now"
* [ ] (CHL) How does conda-forge use channeldata.json?
    * Only known use by c-f: counting # of package namespaces for "By the numbers" on the webpage; other uses deprecated
    * TODO: CEP to deprecate & remove `--use-channeldata` from `conda-build`
    * TODO: CEP to add run exports to `repodata.json`

[2022-04-05](https://hackmd.io/CqkOlf0XQMOh23Wnmt9qTQ)

* TODO: Articulate suggested mechanism for "so you're thinking about taking a contract to work on conda-forge". tl;dr is you should work on a design doc with the impacted parties (or working groups, or interested folks) on the conda-forge side. Once you have agreement on the scope, delivery timeline, and anything that's needed from the conda-forge volunteer side, go ahead and sign that contract with your payer. if you don't do this first, you may encounter some difficulties finishing delivery of your contractual agreement with your payer.
