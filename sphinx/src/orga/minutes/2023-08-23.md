### Your `__new__()` agenda items

- [x] (HV) Drop MacOS <10.13
  - Announcement [PR](https://github.com/conda-forge/conda-forge.github.io/pull/1993); TODO [list](https://github.com/conda-forge/conda-forge.github.io/issues/1844#issuecomment-1675953297), context & discussion. Ecosystem is forcing us to move on (libcxx-trick doesn't help anymore); ≪1% users affected
  - Blocking abseil & grpc [migration](https://github.com/conda-forge/conda-forge-pinning-feedstock/pull/4814) already, soon also libcxx 17
  - Do we want to formulate a more specific support policy? (10.13 is EOL for 3 years already; CPython might jump to 10.15/11.0)
    - (CHL) Could consider following Apple's lifecycle, but be aware that may force us to drop `osx-64` before we're ready to. (Expect ~3 yrs left on Apple's support for such hardware)
    - (JK) If we do a NEP-29 style annoucement, we should align with other projects to make sure `conda`/`conda-forge` is not the odd ecosystem out.
  - MB: macOS 10.14 (Mojave) is the last version to support 32-bit (https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT208436)
  - MB: We could point people with old Macs to https://github.com/dortania/OpenCore-Legacy-Patcher or the like
  - Action items:
    - Someone check the announcement PR to make sure we have all the technical details correct
    - Add `__osx>=10.13` as `run_exports`  to the appropriate compilers packages <- actually a clobber file
      - Docs: https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda-build/en/stable/resources/variants.html#partially-clobbering-recipes
      - I think actually we want recipe_append.yaml (https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda-build/en/stable/resources/variants.html#appending-to-recipes)
      - This will add to run, not clobber it.
      - issue here: https://github.com/conda-forge/conda-forge-ci-setup-feedstock/issues/260
- [x] (HV) Scipy for py312 on win will need a fortran compiler (that's not gfortran)
  - Switch to `meson` requires uniformity of compilers that invalidates current MSVC + gfortran approach
  - Either flang, lfortran (not yet ready), ifx (waiting for Intel follow-up)
  - Been working on [flang](https://github.com/conda-forge/flang-feedstock/pull/28) for half a year, could use some help
  - This will very likely block 3.12 migration (on windows at least)
- [x] (JRG) Miniforge and Mambaforge are now identical (both ship conda-libmamba-solver and mamba).
  - Note: `conda` will switch to conda-libmamba-solver as default in the next release (23.9).
- [x] (JK) CUDA 12 arch migration
    - https://github.com/conda-forge/conda-forge-pinning-feedstock/pull/4799
    - Merge! Merge! Merge!
- [x] (JK) CUDA 11.8
    - https://github.com/conda-forge/conda-forge.github.io/issues/1981
    - John will open a migrator PR
- [x] (JK) GLIBC 2.28
    - Is alma linux a GLIBC option?
    - MRB: WE are in a holding pattern until dust settles.
    - CDTs: we will try and drop as many as possible for cos8
    - issue: https://github.com/conda-forge/cdt-builds/issues/66
- [X] (JK) Windows ARM
    - Getting a machine is challenge.
    - Physical machine is an option. IF we do that it goes to Isuru.  This is for debugging, not CI
    - OK! Going to Isuru.
- [x] (MRB) repodata patches now use yaml files - yay yaml! - i'm moving things over bit by bit, fixing bugs in the process
- [x] (JRG) Repology.org integration
   - https://github.com/repology/repology-updater/issues/518
   - https://github.com/conda-forge/conda-forge.github.io/issues/593


### Pushed to next meeting

- [ ] (HV) [bikeshedding at the end] `-dev` vs. `-devel`
  - came up in boost unification, current PR uses the latter based on Isuru's [rationale](https://github.com/conda-forge/boost-feedstock/pull/164#issuecomment-1681583116)
  - matches Anaconda naming & CDTs, does not match recent CUDA feedstocks, tangentially related to distro discussion (RHEL vs. Debian). We should try to choose one.
  - JRG: Our own data:
    - [`-dev` suffix](https://github.com/search?q=repo%3Aconda-forge%2Ffeedstock-outputs+path%3A%22-dev.json%22&type=code): 33 packages
    - [`-devel` suffix](https://github.com/search?q=repo%3Aconda-forge%2Ffeedstock-outputs+path%3A-devel.json&type=code): 10 packages
- [ ] (JK) NumPy 2.0 planning
    - https://github.com/conda-forge/conda-forge.github.io/issues/1997
    - https://github.com/conda-forge/conda-forge-repodata-patches-feedstock/issues/516
- [ ] (JK) Start using `conda`'s `libmamba` `solver`
    - https://github.com/conda-forge/conda-forge-ci-setup-feedstock/pull/259
    - https://github.com/conda-forge/docker-images/pull/240
