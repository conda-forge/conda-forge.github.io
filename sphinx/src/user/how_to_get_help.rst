How to get help at conda-forge
==============================

You could connect with us via **Element, GitHub Issues or Discourse Group**.
We would be happy to hear from you!

Element chatroom
---------------------

If you are just starting out with conda-forge and/or feel completely lost, we recommend getting in touch through `Element chatroom <https://app.element.io/#/room/#conda-forge:matrix.org>`__. Our community members will direct
you to the proper documentation and/or help you via the chat.

GitHub issues
-------------

You can open issues at `staged-recipes <https://github.com/conda-forge/staged-recipes/issues>`__
to request a new package or to report a problem with staged-recipes itself (our port of entry to conda-forge).

Or you can open an issue about a specific package at the package feedstock via
``https://github.com/conda-forge/<PACKAGE-NAME>-feedstock/issues``

When opening issues, be sure to:

* Try a new environment first following conda-forge :ref:`install instructions <how_to_install>`.
* Always open a new one when an issue is closed. In the packaging world symptoms may be similar but the causes are usually very different.
* Fill in the required information. Without the output of `conda list` and `conda info -a` the team cannot debug the problem.


You can open issues at `conda-forge.github.io <https://github.com/conda-forge/conda-forge.github.io/issues>`__
for long threads involving infrastructural, architectural or ecosystem wide discussions.
Please note that some of these discussions will be turned into policy via the `CFEP process <https://github.com/conda-forge/conda-forge-enhancement-proposals>`__.

Discourse Group
---------------

You can subscribe to our `Discourse group <https://conda.discourse.group>`__ and post your queries there. The Discourse group is a secondary home for long threads about the ecosystem.
